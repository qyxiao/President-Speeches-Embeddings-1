       "\"When it was first perceived, in early times, that no middle course for America remained between unlimited submission to a foreign legislature and a total independence of its claims, men of reflection were less apprehensive of danger from the formidable power of fleets and armies they must determine to resist than from those contests and dissensions which would certainly arise concerning the forms of government to be instituted over the whole and over the parts of this extensive country. Relying, however, on the purity of their intentions, the justice of their cause, and the integrity and intelligence of the people, under an overruling Providence which had so signally protected this country from the first, the representatives of this nation, then consisting of little more than half its present number, not only broke to pieces the chains which were forging and the rod of iron that was lifted up, but frankly cut asunder the ties which had bound them, and launched into an ocean of uncertainty.\\n\\nThe zeal and ardor of the people during the Revolutionary war, supplying the place of government, commanded a degree of order sufficient at least for the temporary preservation of society. The Confederation which was early felt to be necessary was prepared from the models of the Batavian and Helvetic confederacies, the only examples which remain with any detail and precision in history, and certainly the only ones which the people at large had ever considered. But reflecting on the striking difference in so many particulars between this country and those where a courier may go from the seat of government to the frontier in a single day, it was then certainly foreseen by some who assisted in Congress at the formation of it that it could not be durable.\\n\\nNegligence of its regulations, inattention to its recommendations, if not disobedience to its authority, not only in individuals but in States, soon appeared with their melancholy consequences?universal languor, jealousies and rivalries of States, decline of navigation and commerce, discouragement of necessary manufactures, universal fall in the value of lands and their produce, contempt of public and private faith, loss of consideration and credit with foreign nations, and at length in discontents, animosities, combinations, partial conventions, and insurrection, threatening some great national calamity.\\n\\nIn this dangerous crisis the people of America were not abandoned by their usual good sense, presence of mind, resolution, or integrity. Measures were pursued to concert a plan to form a more perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquillity, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty. The public disquisitions, discussions, and deliberations issued in the present happy Constitution of Government.\\n\\nEmployed in the service of my country abroad during the whole course of these transactions, I first saw the Constitution of the United States in a foreign country. Irritated by no literary altercation, animated by no public debate, heated by no party animosity, I read it with great satisfaction, as the result of good heads prompted by good hearts, as an experiment better adapted to the genius, character, situation, and relations of this nation and country than any which had ever been proposed or suggested. In its general principles and great outlines it was conformable to such a system of government as I had ever most esteemed, and in some States, my own native State in particular, had contributed to establish. Claiming a right of suffrage, in common with my fellow-citizens, in the adoption or rejection of a constitution which was to rule me and my posterity, as well as them and theirs, I did not hesitate to express my approbation of it on all occasions, in public and in private. It was not then, nor has been since, any objection to it in my mind that the Executive and Senate were not more permanent. Nor have I ever entertained a thought of promoting any alteration in it but such as the people themselves, in the course of their experience, should see and feel to be necessary or expedient, and by their representatives in Congress and the State legislatures, according to the Constitution itself, adopt and ordain.\\n\\nReturning to the bosom of my country after a painful separation from it for ten years, I had the honor to be elected to a station under the new order of things, and I have repeatedly laid myself under the most serious obligations to support the Constitution. The operation of it has equaled the most sanguine expectations of its friends, and from an habitual attention to it, satisfaction in its administration, and delight in its effects upon the peace, order, prosperity, and happiness of the nation I have acquired an habitual attachment to it and veneration for it.\\n\\nWhat other form of government, indeed, can so well deserve our esteem and love?\\n\\nThere may be little solidity in an ancient idea that congregations of men into cities and nations are the most pleasing objects in the sight of superior intelligences, but this is very certain, that to a benevolent human mind there can be no spectacle presented by any nation more pleasing, more noble, majestic, or august, than an assembly like that which has so often been seen in this and the other Chamber of Congress, of a Government in which the Executive authority, as well as that of all the branches of the Legislature, are exercised by citizens selected at regular periods by their neighbors to make and execute laws for the general good. Can anything essential, anything more than mere ornament and decoration, be added to this by robes and diamonds? Can authority be more amiable and respectable when it descends from accidents or institutions established in remote antiquity than when it springs fresh from the hearts and judgments of an honest and enlightened people? For it is the people only that are represented. It is their power and majesty that is reflected, and only for their good, in every legitimate government, under whatever form it may appear. The existence of such a government as ours for any length of time is a full proof of a general dissemination of knowledge and virtue throughout the whole body of the people. And what object or consideration more pleasing than this can be presented to the human mind? If national pride is ever justifiable or excusable it is when it springs, not from power or riches, grandeur or glory, but from conviction of national innocence, information, and benevolence.\\n\\nIn the midst of these pleasing ideas we should be unfaithful to ourselves if we should ever lose sight of the danger to our liberties if anything partial or extraneous should infect the purity of our free, fair, virtuous, and independent elections. If an election is to be determined by a majority of a single vote, and that can be procured by a party through artifice or corruption, the Government may be the choice of a party for its own ends, not of the nation for the national good. If that solitary suffrage can be obtained by foreign nations by flattery or menaces, by fraud or violence, by terror, intrigue, or venality, the Government may not be the choice of the American people, but of foreign nations. It may be foreign nations who govern us, and not we, the people, who govern ourselves; and candid men will acknowledge that in such cases choice would have little advantage to boast of over lot or chance.\\n\\nSuch is the amiable and interesting system of government (and such are some of the abuses to which it may be exposed) which the people of America have exhibited to the admiration and anxiety of the wise and virtuous of all nations for eight years under the administration of a citizen who, by a long course of great actions, regulated by prudence, justice, temperance, and fortitude, conducting a people inspired with the same virtues and animated with the same ardent patriotism and love of liberty to independence and peace, to increasing wealth and unexampled prosperity, has merited the gratitude of his fellow-citizens, commanded the highest praises of foreign nations, and secured immortal glory with posterity.\\n\\nIn that retirement which is his voluntary choice may he long live to enjoy the delicious recollection of his services, the gratitude of mankind, the happy fruits of them to himself and the world, which are daily increasing, and that splendid prospect of the future fortunes of this country which is opening from year to year. His name may be still a rampart, and the knowledge that he lives a bulwark, against all open or secret enemies of his country's peace. This example has been recommended to the imitation of his successors by both Houses of Congress and by the voice of the legislatures and the people throughout the nation.\\n\\nOn this subject it might become me better to be silent or to speak with diffidence; but as something may be expected, the occasion, I hope, will be admitted as an apology if I venture to say that if a preference, upon principle, of a free republican government, formed upon long and serious reflection, after a diligent and impartial inquiry after truth; if an attachment to the Constitution of the United States, and a conscientious determination to support it until it shall be altered by the judgments and wishes of the people, expressed in the mode prescribed in it; if a respectful attention to the constitutions of the individual States and a constant caution and delicacy toward the State governments; if an equal and impartial regard to the rights, interest, honor, and happiness of all the States in the Union, without preference or regard to a northern or southern, an eastern or western, position, their various political opinions on unessential points or their personal attachments; if a love of virtuous men of all parties and denominations; if a love of science and letters and a wish to patronize every rational effort to encourage schools, colleges, universities, academies, and every institution for propagating knowledge, virtue, and religion among all classes of the people, not only for their benign influence on the happiness of life in all its stages and classes, and of society in all its forms, but as the only means of preserving our Constitution from its natural enemies, the spirit of sophistry, the spirit of party, the spirit of intrigue, the profligacy of corruption, and the pestilence of foreign influence, which is the angel of destruction to elective governments; if a love of equal laws, of justice, and humanity in the interior administration; if an inclination to improve agriculture, commerce, and manufacturers for necessity, convenience, and defense; if a spirit of equity and humanity toward the aboriginal nations of America, and a disposition to meliorate their condition by inclining them to be more friendly to us, and our citizens to be more friendly to them; if an inflexible determination to maintain peace and inviolable faith with all nations, and that system of neutrality and impartiality among the belligerent powers of Europe which has been adopted by this Government and so solemnly sanctioned by both Houses of Congress and applauded by the legislatures of the States and the public opinion, until it shall be otherwise ordained by Congress; if a personal esteem for the French nation, formed in a residence of seven years chiefly among them, and a sincere desire to preserve the friendship which has been so much for the honor and interest of both nations; if, while the conscious honor and integrity of the people of America and the internal sentiment of their own power and energies must be preserved, an earnest endeavor to investigate every just cause and remove every colorable pretense of complaint; if an intention to pursue by amicable negotiation a reparation for the injuries that have been committed on the commerce of our fellow-citizens by whatever nation, and if success can not be obtained, to lay the facts before the Legislature, that they may consider what further measures the honor and interest of the Government and its constituents demand; if a resolution to do justice as far as may depend upon me, at all times and to all nations, and maintain peace, friendship, and benevolence with all the world; if an unshaken confidence in the honor, spirit, and resources of the American people, on which I have so often hazarded my all and never been deceived; if elevated ideas of the high destinies of this country and of my own duties toward it, founded on a knowledge of the moral principles and intellectual improvements of the people deeply engraven on my mind in early life, and not obscured but exalted by experience and age; and, with humble reverence, I feel it to be my duty to add, if a veneration for the religion of a people who profess and call themselves Christians, and a fixed resolution to consider a decent respect for Christianity among the best recommendations for the public service, can enable me in any degree to comply with your wishes, it shall be my strenuous endeavor that this sagacious injunction of the two Houses shall not be without effect.\\n\\nWith this great example before me, with the sense and spirit, the faith and honor, the duty and interest, of the same American people pledged to support the Constitution of the United States, I entertain no doubt of its continuance in all its energy, and my mind is prepared without hesitation to lay myself under the most solemn obligations to support it to the utmost of my power.\\n\\nAnd may that Being who is supreme over all, the Patron of Order, the Fountain of Justice, and the Protector in all ages of the world of virtuous liberty, continue His blessing upon this nation and its Government and give it all possible success and duration consistent with the ends of His providence.\""

       "'Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, my copartners in Government, gentlemen and ladies:   The Constitution imposes upon me the obligation to \"from time to time give to the Congress information of the State of the Union.\" While this has traditionally been interpreted as an annual affair, this tradition has been broken in extraordinary times.   These are extraordinary times. And we face an extraordinary challenge. Our strength as well as our convictions have imposed upon this nation the role of leader in freedom\\'s cause.   No role in history could be more difficult or more important. We stand for freedom. That is our conviction for ourselves\\xe2\\x80\\x94that is our only commitment to others. No friend, no neutral and no adversary should think otherwise. We are not against any man\\xe2\\x80\\x94or any nation\\xe2\\x80\\x94or any system\\xe2\\x80\\x94except as it is hostile to freedom. Nor am I here to present a new military doctrine, bearing any one name or aimed at any one area. I am here to promote the freedom doctrine.   The great battleground for the defense and expansion of freedom today is the whole southern half of the globe\\xe2\\x80\\x94Asia, Latin America, Africa and the Middle East\\xe2\\x80\\x94the lands of the rising peoples. Their revolution is the greatest in human history. They seek an end to injustice, tyranny, and exploitation. More than an end, they seek a beginning.   And theirs is a revolution which we would support regardless of the Cold War, and regardless of which political or economic route they should choose to freedom.   For the adversaries of freedom did not create the revolution; nor did they create the conditions which compel it. But they are seeking to ride the crest of its wave\\xe2\\x80\\x94to capture it for themselves.   Yet their aggression is more often concealed than open. They have fired no missiles; and their troops are seldom seen. They send arms, agitators, aid, technicians and propaganda to every troubled area. But where fighting is required, it is usually done by others\\xe2\\x80\\x94by guerrillas striking at night, by assassins striking alone\\xe2\\x80\\x94assassins who have taken the lives of four thousand civil officers in the last twelve months in Vietnam alone\\xe2\\x80\\x94by subversives and saboteurs and insurrectionists, who in some cases control whole areas inside of independent nations.1   1 At this point the following paragraph, which appears in fine text as signed and transmitted to the Senate and House of Representatives, was omitted in the reading of the message:   They possess a powerful intercontinental striking force, large forces for conventional war, a well-trained underground in nearly every country, the power to conscript talent and manpower for any purpose, the capacity for quick decisions, a closed society without dissent or free information, and long experience in the techniques of violence and subversion. They make the most of their scientific successes, their economic progress and their pose as a foe of colonialism and friend of popular revolution. They prey on unstable or unpopular governments, unsealed, or unknown boundaries, unfilled hopes, convulsive change, massive poverty, illiteracy, unrest and frustration.   With these formidable weapons, the adversaries of freedom plan to consolidate their territory\\xe2\\x80\\x94to exploit, to control, and finally to destroy the hopes of the world\\'s newest nations; and they have ambition to do it before the end of this decade. It is a contest of will and purpose as well as force and violence\\xe2\\x80\\x94a battle for minds and souls as well as lives and territory. And in that contest, we cannot stand aside.   We stand, as we have always stood from our earliest beginnings, for the independence and equality of all nations. This nation was born of revolution and raised in freedom. And we do not intend to leave an open road for despotism.   There is no single simple policy which meets this challenge. Experience has taught us that no one nation has the power or the wisdom to solve all the problems of the world or manage its revolutionary tides\\xe2\\x80\\x94that extending our commitments does not always increase our security\\xe2\\x80\\x94that any initiative carries with it the risk of a temporary defeat\\xe2\\x80\\x94that nuclear weapons cannot prevent subversion\\xe2\\x80\\x94that no free people can be kept free without will and energy of their own\\xe2\\x80\\x94and that no two nations or situations are exactly alike.   Yet there is much we can do\\xe2\\x80\\x94and must do. The proposals I bring before you are numerous and varied. They arise from the host of special opportunities and dangers which have become increasingly clear in recent months. Taken together, I believe that they can mark another step forward in our effort as a people. I am here to ask the help of this Congress and the nation in approving these necessary measures.   II. ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL PROGRESS AT HOME   The first and basic task confronting this nation this year was to turn recession into recovery. An affirmative anti-recession program, initiated with your cooperation, supported the natural forces in the private sector; and our economy is now enjoying renewed confidence and energy. The recession has been halted. Recovery is under way.   But the task of abating unemployment and achieving a full use of our resources does remain a serious challenge for us all. Large-scale unemployment during a recession is bad enough, but large-scale unemployment during a period of prosperity would be intolerable.   I am therefore transmitting to the Congress a new Manpower Development and Training program, to train or retrain several hundred thousand workers, particularly in those areas where we have seen chronic unemployment as a result of technological factors in new occupational skills over a four-year period, in order to replace those skills made obsolete by automation and industrial change with the new skills which the new processes demand.   It should be a satisfaction to us all that we have made great strides in restoring world confidence in the dollar, halting the outflow of gold and improving our balance of payments. During the last two months, our gold stocks actually increased by seventeen million dollars, compared to a loss of 635 million dollars during the last two months of 1960. We must maintain this progress\\xe2\\x80\\x94and this will require the cooperation and restraint of everyone. As recovery progresses, there will be temptations to seek unjustified price and wage increases. These we cannot afford. They will only handicap our efforts to compete abroad and to achieve full recovery here at home. Labor and management must\\xe2\\x80\\x94and I am confident that they will\\xe2\\x80\\x94pursue responsible wage and price policies in these critical times. I look to the President\\'s Advisory Committee on Labor-Management Policy to give a strong lead in this direction.   Moreover, if the budget deficit now increased by the needs of our security is to be held within manageable proportions, it will be necessary to hold tightly to prudent fiscal standards; and I request the cooperation of the Congress in this regard\\xe2\\x80\\x94to refrain from adding funds or programs, desirable as they may be, to the Budget\\xe2\\x80\\x94to end the postal deficit, as my predecessor also recommended, through increased rates\\xe2\\x80\\x94a deficit incidentally, this year, which exceeds the fiscal 1962 cost of all the space and defense measures that I am submitting today\\xe2\\x80\\x94to provide full pay-as-you-go highway financing\\xe2\\x80\\x94and to close those tax loopholes earlier specified. Our security and progress cannot be cheaply purchased; and their price must be found in what we all forego as well as what we all must pay.   III. ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL PROGRESS ABROAD   I stress the strength of our economy because it is essential to the strength of our nation. And what is true in our case is true in the case of other countries. Their strength in the struggle for freedom depends on the strength of their economic and their social progress.   We would be badly mistaken to consider their problems in military terms alone. For no amount of arms and armies can help stabilize those governments which are unable or unwilling to achieve social and economic reform and development. Military pacts cannot help nations whose social injustice and economic chaos invite insurgency and penetration and subversion. The most skillful counter-guerrilla efforts cannot succeed where the local population is too caught up in its own misery to be concerned about the advance of communism.   But for those who share this view, we stand ready now, as we have in the past, to provide generously of our skills, and our capital, and our food to assist the peoples of the less-developed nations to reach their goals in freedom\\xe2\\x80\\x94to help them before they are engulfed in crisis.   This is also our great opportunity in 1961. If we grasp it, then subversion to prevent its success is exposed as an unjustifiable attempt to keep these nations from either being free or equal. But if we do not pursue it, and if they do not pursue it, the bankruptcy of unstable governments, one by one, and of unfilled hopes will surely lead to a series of totalitarian receiverships.   Earlier in the year, I outlined to the Congress a new program for aiding emerging nations; and it is my intention to transmit shortly draft legislation to implement this program, to establish a new Act for International Development, and to add to the figures previously requested, in view of the swift pace of critical events, an additional 250 million dollars for a Presidential Contingency Fund, to be used only upon a Presidential determination in each case, with regular and complete reports to the Congress in each case, when there is a sudden and extraordinary drain upon our regular funds which we cannot foresee\\xe2\\x80\\x94as illustrated by recent events in Southeast Asia\\xe2\\x80\\x94and it makes necessary the use of this emergency reserve. The total amount requested\\xe2\\x80\\x94now raised to 2.65 billion dollars\\xe2\\x80\\x94is both minimal and crucial. I do not see how anyone who is concerned\\xe2\\x80\\x94as we all are\\xe2\\x80\\x94about the growing threats to freedom around the globe\\xe2\\x80\\x94and who is asking what more we can do as a people\\xe2\\x80\\x94can weaken or oppose the single most important program available for building the frontiers of freedom.   IV.   All that I have said makes it clear that we are engaged in a world-wide struggle in which we bear a heavy burden to preserve and promote the ideals that we share with all mankind, or have alien ideals forced upon them. That struggle has highlighted the role of our Information Agency. It is essential that the funds previously requested for this effort be not only approved in full, but increased by 2 million, 400 thousand dollars, to a total of 121 million dollars.   This new request is for additional radio and television to Latin America and Southeast Asia. These tools are particularly effective and essential in the cities and villages of those great continents as a means of reaching millions of uncertain peoples to tell them of our interest in their fight for freedom. In Latin America, we are proposing to increase our Spanish and Portuguese broadcasts to a total of 154 hours a week, compared to 42 hours today, none of which is in Portuguese, the language of about one-third of the people of South America. The Soviets, Red Chinese and satellites already broadcast into Latin America more than 134 hours a week in Spanish and Portuguese. Communist China alone does more public information broadcasting in our own hemisphere than we do. Moreover, powerful propaganda broadcasts from Havana now are heard throughout Latin America, encouraging new revolutions in several countries.   Similarly, in Laos, Vietnam, Cambodia, and Thailand, we must communicate our determination and support to those upon whom our hopes for resisting the communist tide in that continent ultimately depend. Our interest is in the truth.   V. OUR PARTNERSHIP FOR SELF-DEFENSE   But while we talk of sharing and building and the competition of ideas, others talk of arms and threaten war. So we have learned to keep our defenses strong\\xe2\\x80\\x94and to cooperate with others in a partnership of self-defense. The events of recent weeks have caused us to look anew at these efforts.   The center of freedom\\'s defense is our network of world alliances, extending from NATO, recommended by a Democratic President and approved by a Republican Congress, to SEATO, recommended by a Republican President and approved by a Democratic Congress. These alliances were constructed in the 1940\\'s and 1950\\'s\\xe2\\x80\\x94it is our task and responsibility in the 1960\\'s to strengthen them.   To meet the changing conditions of power\\xe2\\x80\\x94and power relationships have changed\\xe2\\x80\\x94we have endorsed an increased emphasis on NATO\\'s conventional strength. At the same time we are affirming our conviction that the NATO nuclear deterrent must also be kept strong. I have made clear our intention to commit to the NATO command, for this purpose, the 5 Polaris submarines originally suggested by President Eisenhower, with the possibility, if needed, of more to come.   Second, a major part of our partnership for self-defense is the Military Assistance Program. The main burden of local defense against local attack, subversion, insurrection or guerrilla warfare must of necessity rest with local forces. Where these forces have the necessary will and capacity to cope with such threats, our intervention is rarely necessary or helpful. Where the will is present and only capacity is lacking, our Military Assistance Program can be of help.   But this program, like economic assistance, needs a new emphasis. It cannot be extended without regard to the social, political and military reforms essential to internal respect and stability. The equipment and training provided must be tailored to legitimate local needs and to our own foreign and military policies, not to our supply of military stocks or a local leader\\'s desire for military display. And military assistance can, in addition to its military purposes, make a contribution to economic progress, as do our own Army Engineers.   In an earlier message, I requested 1.6 billion dollars for Military Assistance, stating that this would maintain existing force levels, but that I could not foresee how much more might be required. It is now clear that this is not enough. The present crisis in Southeast Asia, on which the Vice President has made a valuable report\\xe2\\x80\\x94the rising threat of communism in Latin America-the increased arms traffic in Africa\\xe2\\x80\\x94and all the new pressures on every nation found on the map by tracing your fingers along the borders of the Communist bloc in Asia and the Middle East\\xe2\\x80\\x94all make clear the dimension of our needs.   I therefore request the Congress to provide a total of 1.885 billion dollars for Military Assistance in the coming fiscal year\\xe2\\x80\\x94an amount less than that requested a year ago\\xe2\\x80\\x94but a minimum which must be assured if we are to help those nations make secure their independence. This must be prudently and wisely spent\\xe2\\x80\\x94and that will be our common endeavor. Military and economic assistance has been a heavy burden on our citizens for a long time, and I recognize the strong pressures against it; but this battle is far from over, it is reaching a crucial stage, and I believe we should participate in it. We cannot merely state our opposition to totalitarian advance without paying the price of helping those now under the greatest pressure.   VI. OUR OWN MILITARY AND INTELLIGENCE   In line with these developments, I have directed a further reinforcement of our own capacity to deter or resist non-nuclear aggression. In the conventional field, with one exception, I find no present need for large new levies of men. What is needed is rather a change of position to give us still further increases in flexibility.   Therefore, I am directing the Secretary of Defense to undertake a reorganization and modernization of the Army\\'s divisional structure, to increase its non-nuclear firepower, to improve its tactical mobility in any environment, to insure its flexibility to meet any direct or indirect threat, to facilitate its coordination with our major allies, and to provide more modern mechanized divisions in Europe and bring their equipment up to date, and new airborne brigades in both the Pacific and Europe.   And secondly, I am asking the Congress for an additional 100 million dollars to begin the procurement task necessary to re-equip this new Army structure with the most modern material. New helicopters, new armored personnel carriers, and new howitzers, for example, must be obtained now.   Third, I am directing the Secretary of Defense to expand rapidly and substantially, in cooperation with our Allies, the orientation of existing forces for the conduct of nonnuclear war, para-military operations and sub-limited or unconventional wars.   In addition, our special forces and unconventional warfare units will be increased and reoriented. Throughout the services new emphasis must be placed on the special skills and languages which are required to work with local populations.   Fourth, the Army is developing plans to make possible a much more rapid deployment of a major portion of its highly trained reserve forces. When these plans are completed and the reserve is strengthened, two combat-equipped divisions, plus their supporting forces, a total of 89,000 men, could be ready in an emergency for operations with but 3 weeks notice\\xe2\\x80\\x942 more divisions with but 5 weeks notice\\xe2\\x80\\x94and six additional divisions and their supporting forces, making a total of 10 divisions, could be deployable with less than 8 weeks\\' notice. In short, these new plans will allow us to almost double the combat power of the Army in less than two months, compared to the nearly nine months heretofore required.   Fifth, to enhance the already formidable ability of the Marine Corps to respond to limited war emergencies, I am asking the Congress for 60 million dollars to increase the Marine Corps strength to 190,000 men. This will increase the initial impact and staying power of our three Marine divisions and three air wings, and provide a trained nucleus for further expansion, if necessary for self-defense.   Finally, to cite one other area of activities that are both legitimate and necessary as a means of self-defense in an age of hidden perils, our whole intelligence effort must be reviewed, and its coordination with other elements of policy assured. The Congress and the American people are entitled to know that we will institute whatever new organization, policies, and control are necessary.   VII. CIVIL DEFENSE   One major element of the national security program which this nation has never squarely faced up to is civil defense. This problem arises not from present trends but from national inaction in which most of us have participated. In the past decade we have intermittently considered a variety of programs, but we have never adopted a consistent policy. Public considerations have been largely characterized by apathy, indifference and skepticism; while, at the same time, many of the civil defense plans have been so far-reaching and unrealistic that they have not gained essential support.   This Administration has been looking hard at exactly what civil defense can and cannot do. It cannot be obtained cheaply. It cannot give an assurance of blast protection that will be proof against surprise attack or guaranteed against obsolescence or destruction. And it cannot deter a nuclear attack.   We will deter an enemy from making a nuclear attack only if our retaliatory power is so strong and so invulnerable that he knows he would be destroyed by our response. If we have that strength, civil defense is not needed to deter an attack. If we should ever lack it, civil defense would not be an adequate substitute.   But this deterrent concept assumes rational calculations by rational men. And the history of this planet, and particularly the history of the 20th century, is sufficient to remind us of the possibilities of an irrational attack, a miscalculation, an accidental war, for a war of escalation in which the stakes by each side gradually increase to the point of maximum danger which cannot be either foreseen or deterred. It is on this basis that civil defense can be readily justifiable\\xe2\\x80\\x94as insurance for the civilian population in case of an enemy miscalculation. It is insurance we trust will never be needed\\xe2\\x80\\x94but insurance which we could never forgive ourselves for foregoing in the event of catastrophe.   Once the validity of this concept is recognized, there is no point in delaying the initiation of a nation-wide long-range program of identifying present fallout shelter capacity and providing shelter in new and existing structures. Such a program would protect millions of people against the hazards of radioactive fallout in the event of large-scale nuclear attack. Effective performance of the entire program not only requires new legislative authority and more funds, but also sound organizational arrangements.   Therefore, under the authority vested in me by Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1958, I am assigning responsibility for this program to the top civilian authority already responsible for continental defense, the Secretary of Defense. It is important that this function remain civilian, in nature and leadership; and this feature will not be changed.   The Office of Civil and Defense Mobilization will be reconstituted as a small staff agency to assist in the coordination of these functions. To more accurately describe its role, its title should be changed to the Office of Emergency Planning.   As soon as those newly charged with these responsibilities have prepared new authorization and appropriation requests, such requests will be transmitted to the Congress for a much strengthened Federal-State civil defense program. Such a program will provide Federal funds for identifying fallout shelter capacity in existing structures, and it will include, where appropriate, incorporation of shelter in Federal buildings, new requirements for shelter in buildings constructed with Federal assistance, and matching grants and other incentives for constructing shelter in State and local and private buildings.   Federal appropriations for civil defense in fiscal 1962 under this program will in all likelihood be more than triple the pending budget requests; and they will increase sharply in subsequent years. Financial participation will also be required from State and local governments and from private citizens. But no insurance is cost-free; and every American citizen and his community must decide for themselves whether this form of survival insurance justifies the expenditure of effort, time and money. For myself, I am convinced that it does.   VIII. DISARMAMENT   I cannot end this discussion of defense and armaments without emphasizing our strongest hope: the creation of an orderly world where disarmament will be possible. Our aims do not prepare for war\\xe2\\x80\\x94they are efforts to discourage and resist the adventures of others that could end in war.   That is why it is consistent with these efforts that we continue to press for properly safeguarded disarmament measures. At Geneva, in cooperation with the United Kingdom, we have put forward concrete proposals to make clear our wish to meet the Soviets half way in an effective nuclear test ban treaty\\xe2\\x80\\x94the first significant but essential step on the road towards disarmament. Up to now, their response has not been what we hoped, but Mr. Dean returned last night to Geneva, and we intend to go the last mile in patience to secure this gain if we can.   Meanwhile, we are determined to keep disarmament high on our agenda\\xe2\\x80\\x94to make an intensified effort to develop acceptable political and technical alternatives to the present arms race. To this end I shall send to the Congress a measure to establish a strengthened and enlarged Disarmament Agency.   IX. SPACE   Finally, if we are to win the battle that is now going on around the world between freedom and tyranny, the dramatic achievements in space which occurred in recent weeks should have made clear to us all, as did the Sputnik in 1957, the impact of this adventure on the minds of men everywhere, who are attempting to make a determination of which road they should take. Since early in my term, our efforts in space have been under review. With the advice of the Vice President, who is Chairman of the National Space Council, we have examined where we are strong and where we are not, where we may succeed and where we may not. Now it is time to take longer strides\\xe2\\x80\\x94time for a great new American enterprise\\xe2\\x80\\x94time for this nation to take a clearly leading role in space achievement, which in many ways may hold the key to our future on earth.   I believe we possess all the resources and talents necessary. But the facts of the matter are that we have never made the national decisions or marshaled the national resources required for such leadership. We have never specified long-range goals on an urgent time schedule, or managed our resources and our time so as to insure their fulfillment.   Recognizing the head start obtained by the Soviets with their large rocket engines, which gives them many months of lead-time, and recognizing the likelihood that they will exploit this lead for some time to come in still more impressive successes, we nevertheless are required to make new efforts on our own. For while we cannot guarantee that we shall one day be first, we can guarantee that any failure to make this effort will make us last. We take an additional risk by making it in full view of the world, but as shown by the feat of astronaut Shepard, this very risk enhances our stature when we are successful. But this is not merely a race. Space is open to us now; and our eagerness to share its meaning is not governed by the efforts of others. We go into space because whatever mankind must undertake, free men must fully share.   I therefore ask the Congress, above and beyond the increases I have earlier requested for space activities, to provide the funds which are needed to meet the following national goals:   First, I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth. No single space project in this period will be more impressive to mankind, or more important for the long-range exploration of space; and none will be so difficult or expensive to accomplish. We propose to accelerate the development of the appropriate lunar space craft. We propose to develop alternate liquid and solid fuel boosters, much larger than any now being developed, until certain which is superior. We propose additional funds for other engine development and for unmanned explorations\\xe2\\x80\\x94explorations which are particularly important for one purpose which this nation will never overlook: the survival of the man who first makes this daring flight. But in a very real sense, it will not be one man going to the moon\\xe2\\x80\\x94if we make this judgment affirmatively, it will be an entire nation. For all of us must work to put him there.   Secondly, an additional 23 million dollars, together with 7 million dollars already available, will accelerate development of the Rover nuclear rocket. This gives promise of some day providing a means for even more exciting and ambitious exploration of space, perhaps beyond the moon, perhaps to the very end of the solar system itself.   Third, an additional 50 million dollars will make the most of our present leadership, by accelerating the use of space satellites for world-wide communications.   Fourth, an additional 75 million dollars\\xe2\\x80\\x94of which 53 million dollars is for the Weather Bureau\\xe2\\x80\\x94will help give us at the earliest possible time a satellite system for world-wide weather observation.   Let it be clear\\xe2\\x80\\x94and this is a judgment which the Members of the Congress must finally make\\xe2\\x80\\x94let it be clear that I am asking the Congress and the country to accept a firm commitment to a new course of action\\xe2\\x80\\x94a course which will last for many years and carry very heavy costs: 531 million dollars in fiscal \\'62\\xe2\\x80\\x94an estimated seven to nine billion dollars additional over the next five years. If we are to go only half way, or reduce our sights in the face of difficulty, in my judgment it would be better not to go at all.   Now this is a choice which this country must make, and I am confident that under the leadership of the Space Committees of the Congress, and the Appropriating Committees, that you will consider the matter carefully.   It is a most important decision that we make as a nation. But all of you have lived through the last four years and have seen the significance of space and the adventures in space, and no one can predict with certainty what the ultimate meaning will be of mastery of space.   I believe we should go to the moon. But I think every citizen of this country as well as the Members of the Congress should consider the matter carefully in making their judgment, to which we have given attention over many weeks and months, because it is a heavy burden, and there is no sense in agreeing or desiring that the United States take an affirmative position in outer space, unless we are prepared to do the work and bear the burdens to make it successful. If we are not, we should decide today and this year.   This decision demands a major national commitment of scientific and technical manpower, materiel and facilities, and the possibility of their diversion from other important activities where they are already thinly spread. It means a degree of dedication, organization and discipline which have not always characterized our research and development efforts. It means we cannot afford undue work stoppages, inflated costs of material or talent, wasteful interagency rivalries, or a high turnover of key personnel.   New objectives and new money cannot solve these problems. They could in fact, aggravate them further\\xe2\\x80\\x94unless every scientist, every engineer, every serviceman, every technician, contractor, and civil servant gives his personal pledge that this nation will move forward, with the full speed of freedom, in the exciting adventure of space.   X. CONCLUSION   In conclusion, let me emphasize one point. It is not a pleasure for any President of the United States, as I am sure it was not a pleasure for my predecessors, to come before the Congress and ask for new appropriations which place burdens on our people. I came to this conclusion with some reluctance. But in my judgment, this is a most serious time in the life of our country and in the life of freedom around the globe, and it is the obligation, I believe, of the President of the United States to at least make his recommendations to the Members of the Congress, so that they can reach their own conclusions with that judgment before them. You must decide yourselves, as I have decided, and I am confident that whether you finally decide in the way that I have decided or not, that your judgment\\xe2\\x80\\x94as my judgment\\xe2\\x80\\x94is reached on what is in the best interests of our country.   In conclusion, let me emphasize one point: that we are determined, as a nation in 1961 that freedom shall survive and succeed\\xe2\\x80\\x94and whatever the peril and set-backs, we have some very large advantages.   The first is the simple fact that we are on the side of liberty\\xe2\\x80\\x94and since the beginning of history, and particularly since the end of the Second World War, liberty has been winning out all over the globe.   A second great asset is that we are not alone. We have friends and allies all over the world who share our devotion to freedom. May I cite as a symbol of traditional and effective friendship the great ally I am about to visit\\xe2\\x80\\x94France. I look forward to my visit to France, and to my discussion with a great Captain of the Western World, President de Gaulle, as a meeting of particular significance, permitting the kind of close and ranging consultation that will strengthen both our countries and serve the common purposes of world-wide peace and liberty. Such serious conversations do not require a pale unanimity\\xe2\\x80\\x94they are rather the instruments of trust and understanding over a long road.   A third asset is our desire for peace. It is sincere, and I believe the world knows it. We are proving it in our patience at the test-ban table, and we are proving it in the UN where our efforts have been directed to maintaining that organization\\'s usefulness as a protector of the independence of small nations. In these and other instances, the response of our opponents has not been encouraging.   Yet it is important to know that our patience at the bargaining table is nearly inexhaustible, though our credulity is limited\\xe2\\x80\\x94that our hopes for peace are unfailing, while our determination to protect our security is resolute. For these reasons I have long thought it wise to meet with the Soviet Premier for a personal exchange of views. A meeting in Vienna turned out to be convenient for us both; and the Austrian government has kindly made us welcome. No formal agenda is planned and no negotiations will be undertaken; but we will make dear America\\'s enduring concern is for both peace and freedom\\xe2\\x80\\x94that we are anxious to live in harmony with the Russian people\\xe2\\x80\\x94that we seek no conquests, no satellites, no riches\\xe2\\x80\\x94that we seek only the day when \"nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.\"   Finally, our greatest asset in this struggle is the American people\\xe2\\x80\\x94their willingness to pay the price for these programs\\xe2\\x80\\x94to understand and accept a long struggle\\xe2\\x80\\x94to share their resources with other less fortunate people\\xe2\\x80\\x94to meet the tax levels and close the tax loopholes I have requested\\xe2\\x80\\x94to exercise self-restraint instead of pushing up wages or prices, or over-producing certain crops, or spreading military secrets, or urging unessential expenditures or improper monopolies or harmful work stoppages\\xe2\\x80\\x94to serve in the Peace Corps or the Armed Services or the Federal Civil Service or the Congress\\xe2\\x80\\x94to strive for excellence in their schools, in their cities and in their physical fitness and that of their children\\xe2\\x80\\x94to take part in Civil Defense\\xe2\\x80\\x94to pay higher postal rates, and higher payroll taxes and higher teachers\\' salaries, in order to strengthen our society\\xe2\\x80\\x94to show friendship to students and visitors from other lands who visit us and go back in many cases to be the future leaders, with an image of America\\xe2\\x80\\x94and I want that image, and I know you do, to be affirmative and positive\\xe2\\x80\\x94and, finally, to practice democracy at home, in all States, with all races, to respect each other and to protect the Constitutional rights of all citizens.   I have not asked for a single program which did not cause one or all Americans some inconvenience, or some hardship, or some sacrifice. But they have responded\\xe2\\x80\\x94and you in the Congress have responded to your duty\\xe2\\x80\\x94and I feel confident in asking today for a similar response to these new and larger demands. It is heartening to know, as I journey abroad, that our country is united in its commitment to freedom\\xe2\\x80\\x94and is ready to do its duty.'"

       "u'Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, my copartners in Government, gentlemen and ladies:   The Constitution imposes upon me the obligation to \"from time to time give to the Congress information of the State of the Union.\" While this has traditionally been interpreted as an annual affair, this tradition has been broken in extraordinary times. These are extraordinary times. And we face an extraordinary challenge. Our strength as well as our convictions have imposed upon this nation the role of leader in freedom\\'s cause. No role in history could be more difficult or more important. We stand for freedom. That is our conviction for ourselves\\u2014that is our only commitment to others. No friend, no neutral and no adversary should think otherwise. We are not against any man\\u2014or any nation\\u2014or any system\\u2014except as it is hostile to freedom. Nor am I here to present a new military doctrine, bearing any one name or aimed at any one area. I am here to promote the freedom doctrine. The great battleground for the defense and expansion of freedom today is the whole southern half of the globe\\u2014Asia, Latin America, Africa and the Middle East\\u2014the lands of the rising peoples. Their revolution is the greatest in human history. They seek an end to injustice, tyranny, and exploitation. More than an end, they seek a beginning. And theirs is a revolution which we would support regardless of the Cold War, and regardless of which political or economic route they should choose to freedom. For the adversaries of freedom did not create the revolution; nor did they create the conditions which compel it. But they are seeking to ride the crest of its wave\\u2014to capture it for themselves. Yet their aggression is more often concealed than open. They have fired no missiles; and their troops are seldom seen. They send arms, agitators, aid, technicians and propaganda to every troubled area. But where fighting is required, it is usually done by others\\u2014by guerrillas striking at night, by assassins striking alone\\u2014assassins who have taken the lives of four thousand civil officers in the last twelve months in Vietnam alone\\u2014by subversives and saboteurs and insurrectionists, who in some cases control whole areas inside of independent nations.1   1 At this point the following paragraph, which appears in fine text as signed and transmitted to the Senate and House of Representatives, was omitted in the reading of the message:   They possess a powerful intercontinental striking force, large forces for conventional war, a well-trained underground in nearly every country, the power to conscript talent and manpower for any purpose, the capacity for quick decisions, a closed society without dissent or free information, and long experience in the techniques of violence and subversion. They make the most of their scientific successes, their economic progress and their pose as a foe of colonialism and friend of popular revolution. They prey on unstable or unpopular governments, unsealed, or unknown boundaries, unfilled hopes, convulsive change, massive poverty, illiteracy, unrest and frustration. With these formidable weapons, the adversaries of freedom plan to consolidate their territory\\u2014to exploit, to control, and finally to destroy the hopes of the world\\'s newest nations; and they have ambition to do it before the end of this decade. It is a contest of will and purpose as well as force and violence\\u2014a battle for minds and souls as well as lives and territory. And in that contest, we cannot stand aside. We stand, as we have always stood from our earliest beginnings, for the independence and equality of all nations. This nation was born of revolution and raised in freedom. And we do not intend to leave an open road for despotism. There is no single simple policy which meets this challenge. Experience has taught us that no one nation has the power or the wisdom to solve all the problems of the world or manage its revolutionary tides\\u2014that extending our commitments does not always increase our security\\u2014that any initiative carries with it the risk of a temporary defeat\\u2014that nuclear weapons cannot prevent subversion\\u2014that no free people can be kept free without will and energy of their own\\u2014and that no two nations or situations are exactly alike. Yet there is much we can do\\u2014and must do. The proposals I bring before you are numerous and varied. They arise from the host of special opportunities and dangers which have become increasingly clear in recent months. Taken together, I believe that they can mark another step forward in our effort as a people. I am here to ask the help of this Congress and the nation in approving these necessary measures. II. ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL PROGRESS AT HOME   The first and basic task confronting this nation this year was to turn recession into recovery. An affirmative anti-recession program, initiated with your cooperation, supported the natural forces in the private sector; and our economy is now enjoying renewed confidence and energy. The recession has been halted. Recovery is under way. But the task of abating unemployment and achieving a full use of our resources does remain a serious challenge for us all. Large-scale unemployment during a recession is bad enough, but large-scale unemployment during a period of prosperity would be intolerable. I am therefore transmitting to the Congress a new Manpower Development and Training program, to train or retrain several hundred thousand workers, particularly in those areas where we have seen chronic unemployment as a result of technological factors in new occupational skills over a four-year period, in order to replace those skills made obsolete by automation and industrial change with the new skills which the new processes demand. It should be a satisfaction to us all that we have made great strides in restoring world confidence in the dollar, halting the outflow of gold and improving our balance of payments. During the last two months, our gold stocks actually increased by seventeen million dollars, compared to a loss of 635 million dollars during the last two months of 1960. We must maintain this progress\\u2014and this will require the cooperation and restraint of everyone. As recovery progresses, there will be temptations to seek unjustified price and wage increases. These we cannot afford. They will only handicap our efforts to compete abroad and to achieve full recovery here at home. Labor and management must\\u2014and I am confident that they will\\u2014pursue responsible wage and price policies in these critical times. I look to the President\\'s Advisory Committee on Labor-Management Policy to give a strong lead in this direction. Moreover, if the budget deficit now increased by the needs of our security is to be held within manageable proportions, it will be necessary to hold tightly to prudent fiscal standards; and I request the cooperation of the Congress in this regard\\u2014to refrain from adding funds or programs, desirable as they may be, to the Budget\\u2014to end the postal deficit, as my predecessor also recommended, through increased rates\\u2014a deficit incidentally, this year, which exceeds the fiscal 1962 cost of all the space and defense measures that I am submitting today\\u2014to provide full pay-as-you-go highway financing\\u2014and to close those tax loopholes earlier specified. Our security and progress cannot be cheaply purchased; and their price must be found in what we all forego as well as what we all must pay. III. ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL PROGRESS ABROAD   I stress the strength of our economy because it is essential to the strength of our nation. And what is true in our case is true in the case of other countries. Their strength in the struggle for freedom depends on the strength of their economic and their social progress. We would be badly mistaken to consider their problems in military terms alone. For no amount of arms and armies can help stabilize those governments which are unable or unwilling to achieve social and economic reform and development. Military pacts cannot help nations whose social injustice and economic chaos invite insurgency and penetration and subversion. The most skillful counter-guerrilla efforts cannot succeed where the local population is too caught up in its own misery to be concerned about the advance of communism. But for those who share this view, we stand ready now, as we have in the past, to provide generously of our skills, and our capital, and our food to assist the peoples of the less-developed nations to reach their goals in freedom\\u2014to help them before they are engulfed in crisis. This is also our great opportunity in 1961. If we grasp it, then subversion to prevent its success is exposed as an unjustifiable attempt to keep these nations from either being free or equal. But if we do not pursue it, and if they do not pursue it, the bankruptcy of unstable governments, one by one, and of unfilled hopes will surely lead to a series of totalitarian receiverships. Earlier in the year, I outlined to the Congress a new program for aiding emerging nations; and it is my intention to transmit shortly draft legislation to implement this program, to establish a new Act for International Development, and to add to the figures previously requested, in view of the swift pace of critical events, an additional 250 million dollars for a Presidential Contingency Fund, to be used only upon a Presidential determination in each case, with regular and complete reports to the Congress in each case, when there is a sudden and extraordinary drain upon our regular funds which we cannot foresee\\u2014as illustrated by recent events in Southeast Asia\\u2014and it makes necessary the use of this emergency reserve. The total amount requested\\u2014now raised to 2.65 billion dollars\\u2014is both minimal and crucial. I do not see how anyone who is concerned\\u2014as we all are\\u2014about the growing threats to freedom around the globe\\u2014and who is asking what more we can do as a people\\u2014can weaken or oppose the single most important program available for building the frontiers of freedom. IV. All that I have said makes it clear that we are engaged in a world-wide struggle in which we bear a heavy burden to preserve and promote the ideals that we share with all mankind, or have alien ideals forced upon them. That struggle has highlighted the role of our Information Agency. It is essential that the funds previously requested for this effort be not only approved in full, but increased by 2 million, 400 thousand dollars, to a total of 121 million dollars. This new request is for additional radio and television to Latin America and Southeast Asia. These tools are particularly effective and essential in the cities and villages of those great continents as a means of reaching millions of uncertain peoples to tell them of our interest in their fight for freedom. In Latin America, we are proposing to increase our Spanish and Portuguese broadcasts to a total of 154 hours a week, compared to 42 hours today, none of which is in Portuguese, the language of about one-third of the people of South America. The Soviets, Red Chinese and satellites already broadcast into Latin America more than 134 hours a week in Spanish and Portuguese. Communist China alone does more public information broadcasting in our own hemisphere than we do. Moreover, powerful propaganda broadcasts from Havana now are heard throughout Latin America, encouraging new revolutions in several countries. Similarly, in Laos, Vietnam, Cambodia, and Thailand, we must communicate our determination and support to those upon whom our hopes for resisting the communist tide in that continent ultimately depend. Our interest is in the truth. V. OUR PARTNERSHIP FOR SELF-DEFENSE   But while we talk of sharing and building and the competition of ideas, others talk of arms and threaten war. So we have learned to keep our defenses strong\\u2014and to cooperate with others in a partnership of self-defense. The events of recent weeks have caused us to look anew at these efforts. The center of freedom\\'s defense is our network of world alliances, extending from NATO, recommended by a Democratic President and approved by a Republican Congress, to SEATO, recommended by a Republican President and approved by a Democratic Congress. These alliances were constructed in the 1940\\'s and 1950\\'s\\u2014it is our task and responsibility in the 1960\\'s to strengthen them. To meet the changing conditions of power\\u2014and power relationships have changed\\u2014we have endorsed an increased emphasis on NATO\\'s conventional strength. At the same time we are affirming our conviction that the NATO nuclear deterrent must also be kept strong. I have made clear our intention to commit to the NATO command, for this purpose, the 5 Polaris submarines originally suggested by President Eisenhower, with the possibility, if needed, of more to come. Second, a major part of our partnership for self-defense is the Military Assistance Program. The main burden of local defense against local attack, subversion, insurrection or guerrilla warfare must of necessity rest with local forces. Where these forces have the necessary will and capacity to cope with such threats, our intervention is rarely necessary or helpful. Where the will is present and only capacity is lacking, our Military Assistance Program can be of help. But this program, like economic assistance, needs a new emphasis. It cannot be extended without regard to the social, political and military reforms essential to internal respect and stability. The equipment and training provided must be tailored to legitimate local needs and to our own foreign and military policies, not to our supply of military stocks or a local leader\\'s desire for military display. And military assistance can, in addition to its military purposes, make a contribution to economic progress, as do our own Army Engineers. In an earlier message, I requested 1.6 billion dollars for Military Assistance, stating that this would maintain existing force levels, but that I could not foresee how much more might be required. It is now clear that this is not enough. The present crisis in Southeast Asia, on which the Vice President has made a valuable report\\u2014the rising threat of communism in Latin America-the increased arms traffic in Africa\\u2014and all the new pressures on every nation found on the map by tracing your fingers along the borders of the Communist bloc in Asia and the Middle East\\u2014all make clear the dimension of our needs. I therefore request the Congress to provide a total of 1.885 billion dollars for Military Assistance in the coming fiscal year\\u2014an amount less than that requested a year ago\\u2014but a minimum which must be assured if we are to help those nations make secure their independence. This must be prudently and wisely spent\\u2014and that will be our common endeavor. Military and economic assistance has been a heavy burden on our citizens for a long time, and I recognize the strong pressures against it; but this battle is far from over, it is reaching a crucial stage, and I believe we should participate in it. We cannot merely state our opposition to totalitarian advance without paying the price of helping those now under the greatest pressure. VI. OUR OWN MILITARY AND INTELLIGENCE   In line with these developments, I have directed a further reinforcement of our own capacity to deter or resist non-nuclear aggression. In the conventional field, with one exception, I find no present need for large new levies of men. What is needed is rather a change of position to give us still further increases in flexibility. Therefore, I am directing the Secretary of Defense to undertake a reorganization and modernization of the Army\\'s divisional structure, to increase its non-nuclear firepower, to improve its tactical mobility in any environment, to insure its flexibility to meet any direct or indirect threat, to facilitate its coordination with our major allies, and to provide more modern mechanized divisions in Europe and bring their equipment up to date, and new airborne brigades in both the Pacific and Europe. And secondly, I am asking the Congress for an additional 100 million dollars to begin the procurement task necessary to re-equip this new Army structure with the most modern material. New helicopters, new armored personnel carriers, and new howitzers, for example, must be obtained now. Third, I am directing the Secretary of Defense to expand rapidly and substantially, in cooperation with our Allies, the orientation of existing forces for the conduct of nonnuclear war, para-military operations and sub-limited or unconventional wars. In addition, our special forces and unconventional warfare units will be increased and reoriented. Throughout the services new emphasis must be placed on the special skills and languages which are required to work with local populations. Fourth, the Army is developing plans to make possible a much more rapid deployment of a major portion of its highly trained reserve forces. When these plans are completed and the reserve is strengthened, two combat-equipped divisions, plus their supporting forces, a total of 89,000 men, could be ready in an emergency for operations with but 3 weeks notice\\u20142 more divisions with but 5 weeks notice\\u2014and six additional divisions and their supporting forces, making a total of 10 divisions, could be deployable with less than 8 weeks\\' notice. In short, these new plans will allow us to almost double the combat power of the Army in less than two months, compared to the nearly nine months heretofore required. Fifth, to enhance the already formidable ability of the Marine Corps to respond to limited war emergencies, I am asking the Congress for 60 million dollars to increase the Marine Corps strength to 190,000 men. This will increase the initial impact and staying power of our three Marine divisions and three air wings, and provide a trained nucleus for further expansion, if necessary for self-defense. Finally, to cite one other area of activities that are both legitimate and necessary as a means of self-defense in an age of hidden perils, our whole intelligence effort must be reviewed, and its coordination with other elements of policy assured. The Congress and the American people are entitled to know that we will institute whatever new organization, policies, and control are necessary. VII. CIVIL DEFENSE   One major element of the national security program which this nation has never squarely faced up to is civil defense. This problem arises not from present trends but from national inaction in which most of us have participated. In the past decade we have intermittently considered a variety of programs, but we have never adopted a consistent policy. Public considerations have been largely characterized by apathy, indifference and skepticism; while, at the same time, many of the civil defense plans have been so far-reaching and unrealistic that they have not gained essential support. This Administration has been looking hard at exactly what civil defense can and cannot do. It cannot be obtained cheaply. It cannot give an assurance of blast protection that will be proof against surprise attack or guaranteed against obsolescence or destruction. And it cannot deter a nuclear attack. We will deter an enemy from making a nuclear attack only if our retaliatory power is so strong and so invulnerable that he knows he would be destroyed by our response. If we have that strength, civil defense is not needed to deter an attack. If we should ever lack it, civil defense would not be an adequate substitute. But this deterrent concept assumes rational calculations by rational men. And the history of this planet, and particularly the history of the 20th century, is sufficient to remind us of the possibilities of an irrational attack, a miscalculation, an accidental war, for a war of escalation in which the stakes by each side gradually increase to the point of maximum danger which cannot be either foreseen or deterred. It is on this basis that civil defense can be readily justifiable\\u2014as insurance for the civilian population in case of an enemy miscalculation. It is insurance we trust will never be needed\\u2014but insurance which we could never forgive ourselves for foregoing in the event of catastrophe. Once the validity of this concept is recognized, there is no point in delaying the initiation of a nation-wide long-range program of identifying present fallout shelter capacity and providing shelter in new and existing structures. Such a program would protect millions of people against the hazards of radioactive fallout in the event of large-scale nuclear attack. Effective performance of the entire program not only requires new legislative authority and more funds, but also sound organizational arrangements. Therefore, under the authority vested in me by Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1958, I am assigning responsibility for this program to the top civilian authority already responsible for continental defense, the Secretary of Defense. It is important that this function remain civilian, in nature and leadership; and this feature will not be changed. The Office of Civil and Defense Mobilization will be reconstituted as a small staff agency to assist in the coordination of these functions. To more accurately describe its role, its title should be changed to the Office of Emergency Planning. As soon as those newly charged with these responsibilities have prepared new authorization and appropriation requests, such requests will be transmitted to the Congress for a much strengthened Federal-State civil defense program. Such a program will provide Federal funds for identifying fallout shelter capacity in existing structures, and it will include, where appropriate, incorporation of shelter in Federal buildings, new requirements for shelter in buildings constructed with Federal assistance, and matching grants and other incentives for constructing shelter in State and local and private buildings. Federal appropriations for civil defense in fiscal 1962 under this program will in all likelihood be more than triple the pending budget requests; and they will increase sharply in subsequent years. Financial participation will also be required from State and local governments and from private citizens. But no insurance is cost-free; and every American citizen and his community must decide for themselves whether this form of survival insurance justifies the expenditure of effort, time and money. For myself, I am convinced that it does. VIII. DISARMAMENT   I cannot end this discussion of defense and armaments without emphasizing our strongest hope: the creation of an orderly world where disarmament will be possible. Our aims do not prepare for war\\u2014they are efforts to discourage and resist the adventures of others that could end in war. That is why it is consistent with these efforts that we continue to press for properly safeguarded disarmament measures. At Geneva, in cooperation with the United Kingdom, we have put forward concrete proposals to make clear our wish to meet the Soviets half way in an effective nuclear test ban treaty\\u2014the first significant but essential step on the road towards disarmament. Up to now, their response has not been what we hoped, but Mr. Dean returned last night to Geneva, and we intend to go the last mile in patience to secure this gain if we can. Meanwhile, we are determined to keep disarmament high on our agenda\\u2014to make an intensified effort to develop acceptable political and technical alternatives to the present arms race. To this end I shall send to the Congress a measure to establish a strengthened and enlarged Disarmament Agency. IX. SPACE   Finally, if we are to win the battle that is now going on around the world between freedom and tyranny, the dramatic achievements in space which occurred in recent weeks should have made clear to us all, as did the Sputnik in 1957, the impact of this adventure on the minds of men everywhere, who are attempting to make a determination of which road they should take. Since early in my term, our efforts in space have been under review. With the advice of the Vice President, who is Chairman of the National Space Council, we have examined where we are strong and where we are not, where we may succeed and where we may not. Now it is time to take longer strides\\u2014time for a great new American enterprise\\u2014time for this nation to take a clearly leading role in space achievement, which in many ways may hold the key to our future on earth. I believe we possess all the resources and talents necessary. But the facts of the matter are that we have never made the national decisions or marshaled the national resources required for such leadership. We have never specified long-range goals on an urgent time schedule, or managed our resources and our time so as to insure their fulfillment. Recognizing the head start obtained by the Soviets with their large rocket engines, which gives them many months of lead-time, and recognizing the likelihood that they will exploit this lead for some time to come in still more impressive successes, we nevertheless are required to make new efforts on our own. For while we cannot guarantee that we shall one day be first, we can guarantee that any failure to make this effort will make us last. We take an additional risk by making it in full view of the world, but as shown by the feat of astronaut Shepard, this very risk enhances our stature when we are successful. But this is not merely a race. Space is open to us now; and our eagerness to share its meaning is not governed by the efforts of others. We go into space because whatever mankind must undertake, free men must fully share. I therefore ask the Congress, above and beyond the increases I have earlier requested for space activities, to provide the funds which are needed to meet the following national goals:   First, I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth. No single space project in this period will be more impressive to mankind, or more important for the long-range exploration of space; and none will be so difficult or expensive to accomplish. We propose to accelerate the development of the appropriate lunar space craft. We propose to develop alternate liquid and solid fuel boosters, much larger than any now being developed, until certain which is superior. We propose additional funds for other engine development and for unmanned explorations\\u2014explorations which are particularly important for one purpose which this nation will never overlook: the survival of the man who first makes this daring flight. But in a very real sense, it will not be one man going to the moon\\u2014if we make this judgment affirmatively, it will be an entire nation. For all of us must work to put him there. Secondly, an additional 23 million dollars, together with 7 million dollars already available, will accelerate development of the Rover nuclear rocket. This gives promise of some day providing a means for even more exciting and ambitious exploration of space, perhaps beyond the moon, perhaps to the very end of the solar system itself. Third, an additional 50 million dollars will make the most of our present leadership, by accelerating the use of space satellites for world-wide communications. Fourth, an additional 75 million dollars\\u2014of which 53 million dollars is for the Weather Bureau\\u2014will help give us at the earliest possible time a satellite system for world-wide weather observation. Let it be clear\\u2014and this is a judgment which the Members of the Congress must finally make\\u2014let it be clear that I am asking the Congress and the country to accept a firm commitment to a new course of action\\u2014a course which will last for many years and carry very heavy costs: 531 million dollars in fiscal \\'62\\u2014an estimated seven to nine billion dollars additional over the next five years. If we are to go only half way, or reduce our sights in the face of difficulty, in my judgment it would be better not to go at all. Now this is a choice which this country must make, and I am confident that under the leadership of the Space Committees of the Congress, and the Appropriating Committees, that you will consider the matter carefully. It is a most important decision that we make as a nation. But all of you have lived through the last four years and have seen the significance of space and the adventures in space, and no one can predict with certainty what the ultimate meaning will be of mastery of space. I believe we should go to the moon. But I think every citizen of this country as well as the Members of the Congress should consider the matter carefully in making their judgment, to which we have given attention over many weeks and months, because it is a heavy burden, and there is no sense in agreeing or desiring that the United States take an affirmative position in outer space, unless we are prepared to do the work and bear the burdens to make it successful. If we are not, we should decide today and this year. This decision demands a major national commitment of scientific and technical manpower, materiel and facilities, and the possibility of their diversion from other important activities where they are already thinly spread. It means a degree of dedication, organization and discipline which have not always characterized our research and development efforts. It means we cannot afford undue work stoppages, inflated costs of material or talent, wasteful interagency rivalries, or a high turnover of key personnel. New objectives and new money cannot solve these problems. They could in fact, aggravate them further\\u2014unless every scientist, every engineer, every serviceman, every technician, contractor, and civil servant gives his personal pledge that this nation will move forward, with the full speed of freedom, in the exciting adventure of space. X. CONCLUSION   In conclusion, let me emphasize one point. It is not a pleasure for any President of the United States, as I am sure it was not a pleasure for my predecessors, to come before the Congress and ask for new appropriations which place burdens on our people. I came to this conclusion with some reluctance. But in my judgment, this is a most serious time in the life of our country and in the life of freedom around the globe, and it is the obligation, I believe, of the President of the United States to at least make his recommendations to the Members of the Congress, so that they can reach their own conclusions with that judgment before them. You must decide yourselves, as I have decided, and I am confident that whether you finally decide in the way that I have decided or not, that your judgment\\u2014as my judgment\\u2014is reached on what is in the best interests of our country. In conclusion, let me emphasize one point: that we are determined, as a nation in 1961 that freedom shall survive and succeed\\u2014and whatever the peril and set-backs, we have some very large advantages. The first is the simple fact that we are on the side of liberty\\u2014and since the beginning of history, and particularly since the end of the Second World War, liberty has been winning out all over the globe. A second great asset is that we are not alone. We have friends and allies all over the world who share our devotion to freedom. May I cite as a symbol of traditional and effective friendship the great ally I am about to visit\\u2014France. I look forward to my visit to France, and to my discussion with a great Captain of the Western World, President de Gaulle, as a meeting of particular significance, permitting the kind of close and ranging consultation that will strengthen both our countries and serve the common purposes of world-wide peace and liberty. Such serious conversations do not require a pale unanimity\\u2014they are rather the instruments of trust and understanding over a long road. A third asset is our desire for peace. It is sincere, and I believe the world knows it. We are proving it in our patience at the test-ban table, and we are proving it in the UN where our efforts have been directed to maintaining that organization\\'s usefulness as a protector of the independence of small nations. In these and other instances, the response of our opponents has not been encouraging. Yet it is important to know that our patience at the bargaining table is nearly inexhaustible, though our credulity is limited\\u2014that our hopes for peace are unfailing, while our determination to protect our security is resolute. For these reasons I have long thought it wise to meet with the Soviet Premier for a personal exchange of views. A meeting in Vienna turned out to be convenient for us both; and the Austrian government has kindly made us welcome. No formal agenda is planned and no negotiations will be undertaken; but we will make dear America\\'s enduring concern is for both peace and freedom\\u2014that we are anxious to live in harmony with the Russian people\\u2014that we seek no conquests, no satellites, no riches\\u2014that we seek only the day when \"nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.\" Finally, our greatest asset in this struggle is the American people\\u2014their willingness to pay the price for these programs\\u2014to understand and accept a long struggle\\u2014to share their resources with other less fortunate people\\u2014to meet the tax levels and close the tax loopholes I have requested\\u2014to exercise self-restraint instead of pushing up wages or prices, or over-producing certain crops, or spreading military secrets, or urging unessential expenditures or improper monopolies or harmful work stoppages\\u2014to serve in the Peace Corps or the Armed Services or the Federal Civil Service or the Congress\\u2014to strive for excellence in their schools, in their cities and in their physical fitness and that of their children\\u2014to take part in Civil Defense\\u2014to pay higher postal rates, and higher payroll taxes and higher teachers\\' salaries, in order to strengthen our society\\u2014to show friendship to students and visitors from other lands who visit us and go back in many cases to be the future leaders, with an image of America\\u2014and I want that image, and I know you do, to be affirmative and positive\\u2014and, finally, to practice democracy at home, in all States, with all races, to respect each other and to protect the Constitutional rights of all citizens. I have not asked for a single program which did not cause one or all Americans some inconvenience, or some hardship, or some sacrifice. But they have responded\\u2014and you in the Congress have responded to your duty\\u2014and I feel confident in asking today for a similar response to these new and larger demands. It is heartening to know, as I journey abroad, that our country is united in its commitment to freedom\\u2014and is ready to do its duty.'"

       "'mr . speaker mr . vice president my copartners in government gentlemen and ladies the constitution imposes upon me the obligation to from time to time give to the congress information of the state of the union . while this has traditionally been interpreted as an annual affair this tradition has been broken in extraordinary times . these are extraordinary times . and we face an extraordinary challenge . our strength as well as our convictions have imposed upon this nation the role of leader in freedom s cause . no role in history could be more difficult or more important . we stand for freedom . that is our conviction for ourselves that is our only commitment to others . no friend no neutral and no adversary should think otherwise . we are not against any man or any nation or any system except as it is hostile to freedom . nor am i here to present a new military doctrine bearing any one name or aimed at any one area . i am here to promote the freedom doctrine . the great battleground for the defense and expansion of freedom today is the whole southern half of the globe asia latin america africa and the middle east the lands of the rising peoples . their revolution is the greatest in human history . they seek an end to injustice tyranny and exploitation . more than an end they seek a beginning . and theirs is a revolution which we would support regardless of the cold war and regardless of which political or economic route they should choose to freedom . for the adversaries of freedom did not create the revolution nor did they create the conditions which compel it . but they are seeking to ride the crest of its wave to capture it for themselves . yet their aggression is more often concealed than open . they have fired no missiles and their troops are seldom seen . they send arms agitators aid technicians and propaganda to every troubled area . but where fighting is required it is usually done by others by guerrillas striking at night by assassins striking alone assassins who have taken the lives of four thousand civil officers in the last twelve months in vietnam alone by subversives and saboteurs and insurrectionists who in some cases control whole areas inside of independent nations . 1 1 at this point the following paragraph which appears in fine text as signed and transmitted to the senate and house of representatives was omitted in the reading of the message they possess a powerful intercontinental striking force large forces for conventional war a well trained underground in nearly every country the power to conscript talent and manpower for any purpose the capacity for quick decisions a closed society without dissent or free information and long experience in the techniques of violence and subversion . they make the most of their scientific successes their economic progress and their pose as a foe of colonialism and friend of popular revolution . they prey on unstable or unpopular governments unsealed or unknown boundaries unfilled hopes convulsive change massive poverty illiteracy unrest and frustration . with these formidable weapons the adversaries of freedom plan to consolidate their territory to exploit to control and finally to destroy the hopes of the world s newest nations and they have ambition to do it before the end of this decade . it is a contest of will and purpose as well as force and violence a battle for minds and souls as well as lives and territory . and in that contest we cannot stand aside . we stand as we have always stood from our earliest beginnings for the independence and equality of all nations . this nation was born of revolution and raised in freedom . and we do not intend to leave an open road for despotism . there is no single simple policy which meets this challenge . experience has taught us that no one nation has the power or the wisdom to solve all the problems of the world or manage its revolutionary tides that extending our commitments does not always increase our security that any initiative carries with it the risk of a temporary defeat that nuclear weapons cannot prevent subversion that no free people can be kept free without will and energy of their own and that no two nations or situations are exactly alike . yet there is much we can do and must do . the proposals i bring before you are numerous and varied . they arise from the host of special opportunities and dangers which have become increasingly clear in recent months . taken together i believe that they can mark another step forward in our effort as a people . i am here to ask the help of this congress and the nation in approving these necessary measures . ii . economic and social progress at home the first and basic task confronting this nation this year was to turn recession into recovery . an affirmative anti recession program initiated with your cooperation supported the natural forces in the private sector and our economy is now enjoying renewed confidence and energy . the recession has been halted . recovery is under way . but the task of abating unemployment and achieving a full use of our resources does remain a serious challenge for us all . large scale unemployment during a recession is bad enough but large scale unemployment during a period of prosperity would be intolerable . i am therefore transmitting to the congress a new manpower development and training program to train or retrain several hundred thousand workers particularly in those areas where we have seen chronic unemployment as a result of technological factors in new occupational skills over a four year period in order to replace those skills made obsolete by automation and industrial change with the new skills which the new processes demand . it should be a satisfaction to us all that we have made great strides in restoring world confidence in the dollar halting the outflow of gold and improving our balance of payments . during the last two months our gold stocks actually increased by seventeen million dollars compared to a loss of 635 million dollars during the last two months of 1960 . we must maintain this progress and this will require the cooperation and restraint of everyone . as recovery progresses there will be temptations to seek unjustified price and wage increases . these we cannot afford . they will only handicap our efforts to compete abroad and to achieve full recovery here at home . labor and management must and i am confident that they will pursue responsible wage and price policies in these critical times . i look to the president s advisory committee on labor management policy to give a strong lead in this direction . moreover if the budget deficit now increased by the needs of our security is to be held within manageable proportions it will be necessary to hold tightly to prudent fiscal standards and i request the cooperation of the congress in this regard to refrain from adding funds or programs desirable as they may be to the budget to end the postal deficit as my predecessor also recommended through increased rates a deficit incidentally this year which exceeds the fiscal 1962 cost of all the space and defense measures that i am submitting today to provide full pay as you go highway financing and to close those tax loopholes earlier specified . our security and progress cannot be cheaply purchased and their price must be found in what we all forego as well as what we all must pay . iii . economic and social progress abroad i stress the strength of our economy because it is essential to the strength of our nation . and what is true in our case is true in the case of other countries . their strength in the struggle for freedom depends on the strength of their economic and their social progress . we would be badly mistaken to consider their problems in military terms alone . for no amount of arms and armies can help stabilize those governments which are unable or unwilling to achieve social and economic reform and development . military pacts cannot help nations whose social injustice and economic chaos invite insurgency and penetration and subversion . the most skillful counter guerrilla efforts cannot succeed where the local population is too caught up in its own misery to be concerned about the advance of communism . but for those who share this view we stand ready now as we have in the past to provide generously of our skills and our capital and our food to assist the peoples of the less developed nations to reach their goals in freedom to help them before they are engulfed in crisis . this is also our great opportunity in 1961 . if we grasp it then subversion to prevent its success is exposed as an unjustifiable attempt to keep these nations from either being free or equal . but if we do not pursue it and if they do not pursue it the bankruptcy of unstable governments one by one and of unfilled hopes will surely lead to a series of totalitarian receiverships . earlier in the year i outlined to the congress a new program for aiding emerging nations and it is my intention to transmit shortly draft legislation to implement this program to establish a new act for international development and to add to the figures previously requested in view of the swift pace of critical events an additional 250 million dollars for a presidential contingency fund to be used only upon a presidential determination in each case with regular and complete reports to the congress in each case when there is a sudden and extraordinary drain upon our regular funds which we cannot foresee as illustrated by recent events in southeast asia and it makes necessary the use of this emergency reserve . the total amount requested now raised to 2 . 65 billion dollars is both minimal and crucial . i do not see how anyone who is concerned as we all are about the growing threats to freedom around the globe and who is asking what more we can do as a people can weaken or oppose the single most important program available for building the frontiers of freedom . iv . all that i have said makes it clear that we are engaged in a world wide struggle in which we bear a heavy burden to preserve and promote the ideals that we share with all mankind or have alien ideals forced upon them . that struggle has highlighted the role of our information agency . it is essential that the funds previously requested for this effort be not only approved in full but increased by 2 million 400 thousand dollars to a total of 121 million dollars . this new request is for additional radio and television to latin america and southeast asia . these tools are particularly effective and essential in the cities and villages of those great continents as a means of reaching millions of uncertain peoples to tell them of our interest in their fight for freedom . in latin america we are proposing to increase our spanish and portuguese broadcasts to a total of 154 hours a week compared to 42 hours today none of which is in portuguese the language of about one third of the people of south america . the soviets red chinese and satellites already broadcast into latin america more than 134 hours a week in spanish and portuguese . communist china alone does more public information broadcasting in our own hemisphere than we do . moreover powerful propaganda broadcasts from havana now are heard throughout latin america encouraging new revolutions in several countries . similarly in laos vietnam cambodia and thailand we must communicate our determination and support to those upon whom our hopes for resisting the communist tide in that continent ultimately depend . our interest is in the truth . v . our partnership for self defense but while we talk of sharing and building and the competition of ideas others talk of arms and threaten war . so we have learned to keep our defenses strong and to cooperate with others in a partnership of self defense . the events of recent weeks have caused us to look anew at these efforts . the center of freedom s defense is our network of world alliances extending from nato recommended by a democratic president and approved by a republican congress to seato recommended by a republican president and approved by a democratic congress . these alliances were constructed in the 1940 s and 1950 s it is our task and responsibility in the 1960 s to strengthen them . to meet the changing conditions of power and power relationships have changed we have endorsed an increased emphasis on nato s conventional strength . at the same time we are affirming our conviction that the nato nuclear deterrent must also be kept strong . i have made clear our intention to commit to the nato command for this purpose the 5 polaris submarines originally suggested by president eisenhower with the possibility if needed of more to come . second a major part of our partnership for self defense is the military assistance program . the main burden of local defense against local attack subversion insurrection or guerrilla warfare must of necessity rest with local forces . where these forces have the necessary will and capacity to cope with such threats our intervention is rarely necessary or helpful . where the will is present and only capacity is lacking our military assistance program can be of help . but this program like economic assistance needs a new emphasis . it cannot be extended without regard to the social political and military reforms essential to internal respect and stability . the equipment and training provided must be tailored to legitimate local needs and to our own foreign and military policies not to our supply of military stocks or a local leader s desire for military display . and military assistance can in addition to its military purposes make a contribution to economic progress as do our own army engineers . in an earlier message i requested 1 . 6 billion dollars for military assistance stating that this would maintain existing force levels but that i could not foresee how much more might be required . it is now clear that this is not enough . the present crisis in southeast asia on which the vice president has made a valuable report the rising threat of communism in latin america the increased arms traffic in africa and all the new pressures on every nation found on the map by tracing your fingers along the borders of the communist bloc in asia and the middle east all make clear the dimension of our needs . i therefore request the congress to provide a total of 1 . 885 billion dollars for military assistance in the coming fiscal year an amount less than that requested a year ago but a minimum which must be assured if we are to help those nations make secure their independence . this must be prudently and wisely spent and that will be our common endeavor . military and economic assistance has been a heavy burden on our citizens for a long time and i recognize the strong pressures against it but this battle is far from over it is reaching a crucial stage and i believe we should participate in it . we cannot merely state our opposition to totalitarian advance without paying the price of helping those now under the greatest pressure . vi . our own military and intelligence in line with these developments i have directed a further reinforcement of our own capacity to deter or resist non nuclear aggression . in the conventional field with one exception i find no present need for large new levies of men . what is needed is rather a change of position to give us still further increases in flexibility . therefore i am directing the secretary of defense to undertake a reorganization and modernization of the army s divisional structure to increase its non nuclear firepower to improve its tactical mobility in any environment to insure its flexibility to meet any direct or indirect threat to facilitate its coordination with our major allies and to provide more modern mechanized divisions in europe and bring their equipment up to date and new airborne brigades in both the pacific and europe . and secondly i am asking the congress for an additional 100 million dollars to begin the procurement task necessary to re equip this new army structure with the most modern material . new helicopters new armored personnel carriers and new howitzers for example must be obtained now . third i am directing the secretary of defense to expand rapidly and substantially in cooperation with our allies the orientation of existing forces for the conduct of nonnuclear war para military operations and sub limited or unconventional wars . in addition our special forces and unconventional warfare units will be increased and reoriented . throughout the services new emphasis must be placed on the special skills and languages which are required to work with local populations . fourth the army is developing plans to make possible a much more rapid deployment of a major portion of its highly trained reserve forces . when these plans are completed and the reserve is strengthened two combat equipped divisions plus their supporting forces a total of 89 000 men could be ready in an emergency for operations with but 3 weeks notice 2 more divisions with but 5 weeks notice and six additional divisions and their supporting forces making a total of 10 divisions could be deployable with less than 8 weeks notice . in short these new plans will allow us to almost double the combat power of the army in less than two months compared to the nearly nine months heretofore required . fifth to enhance the already formidable ability of the marine corps to respond to limited war emergencies i am asking the congress for 60 million dollars to increase the marine corps strength to 190 000 men . this will increase the initial impact and staying power of our three marine divisions and three air wings and provide a trained nucleus for further expansion if necessary for self defense . finally to cite one other area of activities that are both legitimate and necessary as a means of self defense in an age of hidden perils our whole intelligence effort must be reviewed and its coordination with other elements of policy assured . the congress and the american people are entitled to know that we will institute whatever new organization policies and control are necessary . vii . civil defense one major element of the national security program which this nation has never squarely faced up to is civil defense . this problem arises not from present trends but from national inaction in which most of us have participated . in the past decade we have intermittently considered a variety of programs but we have never adopted a consistent policy . public considerations have been largely characterized by apathy indifference and skepticism while at the same time many of the civil defense plans have been so far reaching and unrealistic that they have not gained essential support . this administration has been looking hard at exactly what civil defense can and cannot do . it cannot be obtained cheaply . it cannot give an assurance of blast protection that will be proof against surprise attack or guaranteed against obsolescence or destruction . and it cannot deter a nuclear attack . we will deter an enemy from making a nuclear attack only if our retaliatory power is so strong and so invulnerable that he knows he would be destroyed by our response . if we have that strength civil defense is not needed to deter an attack . if we should ever lack it civil defense would not be an adequate substitute . but this deterrent concept assumes rational calculations by rational men . and the history of this planet and particularly the history of the 20th century is sufficient to remind us of the possibilities of an irrational attack a miscalculation an accidental war for a war of escalation in which the stakes by each side gradually increase to the point of maximum danger which cannot be either foreseen or deterred . it is on this basis that civil defense can be readily justifiable as insurance for the civilian population in case of an enemy miscalculation . it is insurance we trust will never be needed but insurance which we could never forgive ourselves for foregoing in the event of catastrophe . once the validity of this concept is recognized there is no point in delaying the initiation of a nation wide long range program of identifying present fallout shelter capacity and providing shelter in new and existing structures . such a program would protect millions of people against the hazards of radioactive fallout in the event of large scale nuclear attack . effective performance of the entire program not only requires new legislative authority and more funds but also sound organizational arrangements . therefore under the authority vested in me by reorganization plan no . 1 of 1958 i am assigning responsibility for this program to the top civilian authority already responsible for continental defense the secretary of defense . it is important that this function remain civilian in nature and leadership and this feature will not be changed . the office of civil and defense mobilization will be reconstituted as a small staff agency to assist in the coordination of these functions . to more accurately describe its role its title should be changed to the office of emergency planning . as soon as those newly charged with these responsibilities have prepared new authorization and appropriation requests such requests will be transmitted to the congress for a much strengthened federal state civil defense program . such a program will provide federal funds for identifying fallout shelter capacity in existing structures and it will include where appropriate incorporation of shelter in federal buildings new requirements for shelter in buildings constructed with federal assistance and matching grants and other incentives for constructing shelter in state and local and private buildings . federal appropriations for civil defense in fiscal 1962 under this program will in all likelihood be more than triple the pending budget requests and they will increase sharply in subsequent years . financial participation will also be required from state and local governments and from private citizens . but no insurance is cost free and every american citizen and his community must decide for themselves whether this form of survival insurance justifies the expenditure of effort time and money . for myself i am convinced that it does . viii . disarmament i cannot end this discussion of defense and armaments without emphasizing our strongest hope the creation of an orderly world where disarmament will be possible . our aims do not prepare for war they are efforts to discourage and resist the adventures of others that could end in war . that is why it is consistent with these efforts that we continue to press for properly safeguarded disarmament measures . at geneva in cooperation with the united kingdom we have put forward concrete proposals to make clear our wish to meet the soviets half way in an effective nuclear test ban treaty the first significant but essential step on the road towards disarmament . up to now their response has not been what we hoped but mr . dean returned last night to geneva and we intend to go the last mile in patience to secure this gain if we can . meanwhile we are determined to keep disarmament high on our agenda to make an intensified effort to develop acceptable political and technical alternatives to the present arms race . to this end i shall send to the congress a measure to establish a strengthened and enlarged disarmament agency . ix . space finally if we are to win the battle that is now going on around the world between freedom and tyranny the dramatic achievements in space which occurred in recent weeks should have made clear to us all as did the sputnik in 1957 the impact of this adventure on the minds of men everywhere who are attempting to make a determination of which road they should take . since early in my term our efforts in space have been under review . with the advice of the vice president who is chairman of the national space council we have examined where we are strong and where we are not where we may succeed and where we may not . now it is time to take longer strides time for a great new american enterprise time for this nation to take a clearly leading role in space achievement which in many ways may hold the key to our future on earth . i believe we possess all the resources and talents necessary . but the facts of the matter are that we have never made the national decisions or marshaled the national resources required for such leadership . we have never specified long range goals on an urgent time schedule or managed our resources and our time so as to insure their fulfillment . recognizing the head start obtained by the soviets with their large rocket engines which gives them many months of lead time and recognizing the likelihood that they will exploit this lead for some time to come in still more impressive successes we nevertheless are required to make new efforts on our own . for while we cannot guarantee that we shall one day be first we can guarantee that any failure to make this effort will make us last . we take an additional risk by making it in full view of the world but as shown by the feat of astronaut shepard this very risk enhances our stature when we are successful . but this is not merely a race . space is open to us now and our eagerness to share its meaning is not governed by the efforts of others . we go into space because whatever mankind must undertake free men must fully share . i therefore ask the congress above and beyond the increases i have earlier requested for space activities to provide the funds which are needed to meet the following national goals first i believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal before this decade is out of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth . no single space project in this period will be more impressive to mankind or more important for the long range exploration of space and none will be so difficult or expensive to accomplish . we propose to accelerate the development of the appropriate lunar space craft . we propose to develop alternate liquid and solid fuel boosters much larger than any now being developed until certain which is superior . we propose additional funds for other engine development and for unmanned explorations explorations which are particularly important for one purpose which this nation will never overlook the survival of the man who first makes this daring flight . but in a very real sense it will not be one man going to the moon if we make this judgment affirmatively it will be an entire nation . for all of us must work to put him there . secondly an additional 23 million dollars together with 7 million dollars already available will accelerate development of the rover nuclear rocket . this gives promise of some day providing a means for even more exciting and ambitious exploration of space perhaps beyond the moon perhaps to the very end of the solar system itself . third an additional 50 million dollars will make the most of our present leadership by accelerating the use of space satellites for world wide communications . fourth an additional 75 million dollars of which 53 million dollars is for the weather bureau will help give us at the earliest possible time a satellite system for world wide weather observation . let it be clear and this is a judgment which the members of the congress must finally make let it be clear that i am asking the congress and the country to accept a firm commitment to a new course of action a course which will last for many years and carry very heavy costs 531 million dollars in fiscal 62 an estimated seven to nine billion dollars additional over the next five years . if we are to go only half way or reduce our sights in the face of difficulty in my judgment it would be better not to go at all . now this is a choice which this country must make and i am confident that under the leadership of the space committees of the congress and the appropriating committees that you will consider the matter carefully . it is a most important decision that we make as a nation . but all of you have lived through the last four years and have seen the significance of space and the adventures in space and no one can predict with certainty what the ultimate meaning will be of mastery of space . i believe we should go to the moon . but i think every citizen of this country as well as the members of the congress should consider the matter carefully in making their judgment to which we have given attention over many weeks and months because it is a heavy burden and there is no sense in agreeing or desiring that the united states take an affirmative position in outer space unless we are prepared to do the work and bear the burdens to make it successful . if we are not we should decide today and this year . this decision demands a major national commitment of scientific and technical manpower materiel and facilities and the possibility of their diversion from other important activities where they are already thinly spread . it means a degree of dedication organization and discipline which have not always characterized our research and development efforts . it means we cannot afford undue work stoppages inflated costs of material or talent wasteful interagency rivalries or a high turnover of key personnel . new objectives and new money cannot solve these problems . they could in fact aggravate them further unless every scientist every engineer every serviceman every technician contractor and civil servant gives his personal pledge that this nation will move forward with the full speed of freedom in the exciting adventure of space . x . conclusion in conclusion let me emphasize one point . it is not a pleasure for any president of the united states as i am sure it was not a pleasure for my predecessors to come before the congress and ask for new appropriations which place burdens on our people . i came to this conclusion with some reluctance . but in my judgment this is a most serious time in the life of our country and in the life of freedom around the globe and it is the obligation i believe of the president of the united states to at least make his recommendations to the members of the congress so that they can reach their own conclusions with that judgment before them . you must decide yourselves as i have decided and i am confident that whether you finally decide in the way that i have decided or not that your judgment as my judgment is reached on what is in the best interests of our country . in conclusion let me emphasize one point that we are determined as a nation in 1961 that freedom shall survive and succeed and whatever the peril and set backs we have some very large advantages . the first is the simple fact that we are on the side of liberty and since the beginning of history and particularly since the end of the second world war liberty has been winning out all over the globe . a second great asset is that we are not alone . we have friends and allies all over the world who share our devotion to freedom . may i cite as a symbol of traditional and effective friendship the great ally i am about to visit france . i look forward to my visit to france and to my discussion with a great captain of the western world president de gaulle as a meeting of particular significance permitting the kind of close and ranging consultation that will strengthen both our countries and serve the common purposes of world wide peace and liberty . such serious conversations do not require a pale unanimity they are rather the instruments of trust and understanding over a long road . a third asset is our desire for peace . it is sincere and i believe the world knows it . we are proving it in our patience at the test ban table and we are proving it in the un where our efforts have been directed to maintaining that organization s usefulness as a protector of the independence of small nations . in these and other instances the response of our opponents has not been encouraging . yet it is important to know that our patience at the bargaining table is nearly inexhaustible though our credulity is limited that our hopes for peace are unfailing while our determination to protect our security is resolute . for these reasons i have long thought it wise to meet with the soviet premier for a personal exchange of views . a meeting in vienna turned out to be convenient for us both and the austrian government has kindly made us welcome . no formal agenda is planned and no negotiations will be undertaken but we will make dear america s enduring concern is for both peace and freedom that we are anxious to live in harmony with the russian people that we seek no conquests no satellites no riches that we seek only the day when nation shall not lift up sword against nation neither shall they learn war any more . finally our greatest asset in this struggle is the american people their willingness to pay the price for these programs to understand and accept a long struggle to share their resources with other less fortunate people to meet the tax levels and close the tax loopholes i have requested to exercise self restraint instead of pushing up wages or prices or over producing certain crops or spreading military secrets or urging unessential expenditures or improper monopolies or harmful work stoppages to serve in the peace corps or the armed services or the federal civil service or the congress to strive for excellence in their schools in their cities and in their physical fitness and that of their children to take part in civil defense to pay higher postal rates and higher payroll taxes and higher teachers salaries in order to strengthen our society to show friendship to students and visitors from other lands who visit us and go back in many cases to be the future leaders with an image of america and i want that image and i know you do to be affirmative and positive and finally to practice democracy at home in all states with all races to respect each other and to protect the constitutional rights of all citizens . i have not asked for a single program which did not cause one or all americans some inconvenience or some hardship or some sacrifice . but they have responded and you in the congress have responded to your duty and i feel confident in asking today for a similar response to these new and larger demands . it is heartening to know as i journey abroad that our country is united in its commitment to freedom and is ready to do its duty .'"
