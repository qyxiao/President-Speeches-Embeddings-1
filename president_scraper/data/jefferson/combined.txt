 FRIENDS AND FELLOW-CITIZENS,   Called upon to undertake the duties of the first executive office of our country,   I avail myself of the presence of that portion of my fellow-citizens which is   here assembled to express my grateful thanks for the favor with which they have   been pleased to look toward me, to declare a sincere consciousness that the   task is above my talents, and that I approach it with those anxious and awful   presentiments which the greatness of the charge and the weakness of my powers   so justly inspire. A rising nation, spread over a wide and fruitful land, traversing   all the seas with the rich productions of their industry, engaged in commerce   with nations who feel power and forget right, advancing rapidly to destinies   beyond the reach of mortal eye -- when I contemplate these transcendent objects,   and see the honor, the happiness, and the hopes of this beloved country committed   to the issue and the auspices of this day, I shrink from the contemplation,   and humble myself before the magnitude of the undertaking. Utterly, indeed,   should I despair did not the presence of many whom I here see remind me that   in the other high authorities provided by our Constitution I shall find resources   of wisdom, of virtue, and of zeal on which to rely under all difficulties. To   you, then, gentlemen, who are charged with the sovereign functions of legislation,   and to those associated with you, I look with encouragement for that guidance   and support which may enable us to steer with safety the vessel in which we   are all embarked amidst the conflicting elements of a troubled world. During the contest of opinion through which we have passed the animation of   discussions and of exertions has sometimes worn an aspect which might impose   on strangers unused to think freely and to speak and to write what they think;   but this being now decided by the voice of the nation, announced according to   the rules of the Constitution, all will, of course, arrange themselves under   the will of the law, and unite in common efforts for the common good. All, too,   will bear in mind this sacred principle, that though the will of the majority   is in all cases to prevail, that will to be rightful must be reasonable; that   the minority possess their equal rights, which equal law must protect, and to   violate would be oppression. Let us, then, fellow-citizens, unite with one heart   and one mind. Let us restore to social intercourse that harmony and affection   without which liberty and even life itself are but dreary things. And let us   reflect that, having banished from our land that religious intolerance under   which mankind so long bled and suffered, we have yet gained little if we countenance   a political intolerance as despotic, as wicked, and capable of as bitter and   bloody persecutions. During the throes and convulsions of the ancient world,   during the agonizing spasms of infuriated man, seeking through blood and slaughter   his long-lost liberty, it was not wonderful that the agitation of the billows   should reach even this distant and peaceful shore; that this should be more   felt and feared by some and less by others, and should divide opinions as to   measures of safety. But every difference of opinion is not a difference of principle.   We have called by different names brethren of the same principle. We are all   Republicans, we are all Federalists. If there be any among us who would wish   to dissolve this Union or to change its republican form, let them stand undisturbed   as monuments of the safety with which error of opinion may be tolerated where   reason is left free to combat it. I know, indeed, that some honest men fear   that a republican government can not be strong, that this Government is not   strong enough; but would the honest patriot, in the full tide of successful   experiment, abandon a government which has so far kept us free and firm on the   theoretic and visionary fear that this Government, the world's best hope, may   by possibility want energy to preserve itself? I trust not. I believe this,   on the contrary, the strongest Government on earth. I believe it the only one   where every man, at the call of the law, would fly to the standard of the law,   and would meet invasions of the public order as his own personal concern. Sometimes   it is said that man can not be trusted with the government of himself. Can he,   then, be trusted with the government of others? Or have we found angels in the   forms of kings to govern him? Let history answer this question. Let us, then, with courage and confidence pursue our own Federal and Republican   principles, our attachment to union and representative government. Kindly separated   by nature and a wide ocean from the exterminating havoc of one quarter of the   globe; too high-minded to endure the degradations of the others; possessing   a chosen country, with room enough for our descendants to the thousandth and   thousandth generation; entertaining a due sense of our equal right to the use   of our own faculties, to the acquisitions of our own industry, to honor and   confidence from our fellow-citizens, resulting not from birth, but from our   actions and their sense of them; enlightened by a benign religion, professed,   indeed, and practiced in various forms, yet all of them inculcating honesty,   truth, temperance, gratitude, and the love of man; acknowledging and adoring   an overruling Providence, which by all its dispensations proves that it delights   in the happiness of man here and his greater happiness hereafter -- with all   these blessings, what more is necessary to make us a happy and a prosperous   people? Still one thing more, fellow-citizens -- a wise and frugal Government,   which shall restrain men from injuring one another, shall leave them otherwise   free to regulate their own pursuits of industry and improvement, and shall not   take from the mouth of labor the bread it has earned. This is the sum of good   government, and this is necessary to close the circle of our felicities. About to enter, fellow-citizens, on the exercise of duties which comprehend   everything dear and valuable to you, it is proper you should understand what   I deem the essential principles of our Government, and consequently those which   ought to shape its Administration. I will compress them within the narrowest   compass they will bear, stating the general principle, but not all its limitations.   Equal and exact justice to all men, of whatever state or persuasion, religious   or political; peace, commerce, and honest friendship with all nations, entangling   alliances with none; the support of the State governments in all their rights,   as the most competent administrations for our domestic concerns and the surest   bulwarks against antirepublican tendencies; the preservation of the General   Government in its whole constitutional vigor, as the sheet anchor of our peace   at home and safety abroad; a jealous care of the right of election by the people   -- a mild and safe corrective of abuses which are lopped by the sword of revolution   where peaceable remedies are unprovided; absolute acquiescence in the decisions   of the majority, the vital principle of republics, from which is no appeal but   to force, the vital principle and immediate parent of despotism; a well-disciplined   militia, our best reliance in peace and for the first moments of war till regulars   may relieve them; the supremacy of the civil over the military authority; economy   in the public expense, that labor may be lightly burthened; the honest payment   of our debts and sacred preservation of the public faith; encouragement of agriculture,   and of commerce as its handmaid; the diffusion of information and arraignment   of all abuses at the bar of the public reason; freedom of religion; freedom   of the press, and freedom of person under the protection of the habeas corpus,   and trial by juries impartially selected. These principles form the bright constellation   which has gone before us and guided our steps through an age of revolution and   reformation. The wisdom of our sages and blood of our heroes have been devoted   to their attainment. They should be the creed of our political faith, the text   of civic instruction, the touchstone by which to try the services of those we   trust; and should we wander from them in moments of error or of alarm, let us   hasten to retrace our steps and to regain the road which alone leads to peace,   liberty, and safety. I repair, then, fellow-citizens, to the post you have assigned me. With experience   enough in subordinate offices to have seen the difficulties of this the greatest   of all, I have learnt to expect that it will rarely fall to the lot of imperfect   man to retire from this station with the reputation and the favor which bring   him into it. Without pretensions to that high confidence you reposed in our   first and greatest revolutionary character, whose preeminent services had entitled   him to the first place in his country's love and destined for him the fairest   page in the volume of faithful history, I ask so much confidence only as may   give firmness and effect to the legal administration of your affairs. I shall   often go wrong through defect of judgment. When right, I shall often be thought   wrong by those whose positions will not command a view of the whole ground.   I ask your indulgence for my own errors, which will never be intentional, and   your support against the errors of others, who may condemn what they would not   if seen in all its parts. The approbation implied by your suffrage is a great   consolation to me for the past, and my future solicitude will be to retain the   good opinion of those who have bestowed it in advance, to conciliate that of   others by doing them all the good in my power, and to be instrumental to the   happiness and freedom of all. Relying, then, on the patronage of your good will, I advance with obedience   to the work, ready to retire from it whenever you become sensible how much better   choice it is in your power to make. And may that Infinite Power which rules   the destinies of the universe lead our councils to what is best, and give them   a favorable issue for your peace and prosperity. GENTLEMAN,  I have received the remonstrance you were pleased to address to me, on the   appointment of Samuel Bishop to the office of collector of New Haven, lately   vacated by the death of David Austin. The right of our fellow citizens to represent   to the public functionaries their opinion on proceedings interesting to them,   is unquestionably a constitutional right, often useful, sometimes necessary,   and will always be respectfully acknoleged by me.  Of the various executive duties, no one excites more anxious concern than   that of placing the interests of our fellow citizens in the hands of honest   men, with understandings sufficient for their station. No duty, at the same   time, is more difficult to fulfil. The knolege of characters possessed by a   single individual is, of necessity, limited. To seek out the best through the   whole Union, we must resort to other information, which, from the best of men,   acting disinterestedly and with the purest motives, is sometimes incorrect.   In the case of Samuel Bishop, however, the subject of your remonstrance, time   was taken, information was sought, & such obtained as could leave no room   for doubt of his fitness. From private sources it was learnt that his understanding   was sound, his integrity pure, his character unstained. And the offices confided   to him within his own State, are public evidences of the estimation in which   he is held by the State in general, and the city & township particularly   in which he lives. He is said to be the town clerk, a justice of the peace,   mayor of the city of New Haven, an office held at the will of the legislature,   chief judge of the court of common pleas for New Haven county, a court of high   criminal and civil jurisdiction wherein most causes are decided without the   right of appeal or review, and sole judge of the court of probates, wherein   he singly decides all questions of wills, settlement of estates, testate and   intestate, appoints guardians, settles their accounts, and in fact has under   his jurisdiction and care all the property real and personal of persons dying.   The two last   offices, in the annual gift of the legislature, were given to him in May last.   Is it possible that the man to whom the legislature of Connecticut has so recently   committed trusts of such difficulty & magnitude, is `unfit to be the collector   of the district of New Haven,' tho' acknoleged in the same writing, to have   obtained all this confidence `by a long life of usefulness?' It is objected,   indeed, in the remonstrance, that he is 77. years of age; but at a much more   advanced age, our Franklin was the ornament of human nature. He may not be able   to perform in person, all the details of his office; but if he gives us the   benefit of his understanding, his integrity, his watchfulness, and takes care   that all the details are well performed by himself or his necessary assistants,   all public purposes will be answered. The remonstrance, indeed, does not allege   that the office has been illy conducted, but only apprehends that it will be   so. Should this happen in event, be assured I will do in it what shall be just   and necessary for the public service. In the meantime, he should be tried without   being prejudged.  The removal, as it is called, of Mr. Goodrich, forms another subject of complaint.   Declarations by myself in favor of political tolerance, exhortations to harmony   and affection in social intercourse, and to respect for the equal rights of   the minority, have, on certain occasions, been quoted & misconstrued into   assurances that the tenure of offices was to be undisturbed. But could candor   apply such a construction? It is not indeed in the remonstrance that we find   it; but it leads to the explanations which that calls for. When it is considered,   that during the late administration, those who were not of a particular sect   of politics were excluded from all office; when, by a steady pursuit of this   measure, nearly the whole offices of the U S were monopolized by that sect;   when the public sentiment at length declared itself, and burst open the doors   of honor and confidence to those whose opinions they more approved, was it to   be imagined that this monopoly of office was still to be continued in the hands   of the minority? Does it violate their equal rights, to assert some rights in   the majority also? Is it political intolerance to claim a proportionate share   in the direction of the public affairs? Can they not harmonize in society unless   they have everything in their own hands? If the will of the nation, manifested by their various elections, calls for an   administration of government according with the opinions of those elected; if,   for the fulfilment of that will, displacements are necessary, with whom can   they so justly begin as with persons appointed in the last moments of an administration,   not for its own aid, but to begin a career at the same time with their successors,   by whom they had never been approved, and who could scarcely expect from them   a cordial cooperation? Mr. Goodrich was one of these. Was it proper for him   to place himself in office, without knowing whether those whose agent he was   to be would have confidence in his agency? Can the preference of another, as   the successor to Mr. Austin, be candidly called a removal of Mr. Goodrich? If   a due participation of office is a matter of right, how are vacancies to be   obtained? Those by death are few; by resignation, none. Can any other mode than   that of removal be proposed? This is a painful office; but it is made my duty,   and I meet it as such. I proceed in the operation with deliberation & inquiry,   that it may injure the best men least, and effect the purposes of justice &   public utility with the least private distress; that it may be thrown, as much   as possible, on delinquency, on oppression, on intolerance, on incompetence,   on ante-revolutionary adherence to our enemies.  The remonstrance laments "that a change in the administration must produce   a change in the subordinate officers;" in other words, that it should be   deemed necessary for all officers to think with their principal. But on whom   does this imputation bear? On those who have excluded from office every shade   of opinion which was not theirs? Or on those who have been so excluded? lament   sincerely that unessential differences of political opinion should ever have   been deemed sufficient to interdict half the society from the rights and the   blessings of self-government, to proscribe them as characters unworthy of every   trust. It would have been to me a circumstance of great relief, had I found   a moderate participation of office in the hands of the majority. I would gladly   have left to time and accident to raise them to their just share. But their   total exclusion calls for prompter correctives. shall correct the procedure;   but that done, disdain to follow it,   shall return with joy to that state of things, when the only questions concerning   a candidate shall be, is he honest? Is he capable? Is he faithful to the Constitution?  I tender you the homage of my high respect. FELLOW CITIZENS OF THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:          It is a circumstance of sincere gratification to me that on meeting the great   council of our nation, I am able to announce to them, on the grounds of reasonable   certainty, that the wars and troubles which have for so many years afflicted   our sister nations have at length come to an end, and that the communications   of peace and commerce are once more opening among them. While we devoutly return   thanks to the beneficent Being who has been pleased to breathe into them the   spirit of conciliation and forgiveness, we are bound with peculiar gratitude   to be thankful to him that our own peace has been preserved through so perilous   a season, and ourselves permitted quietly to cultivate the earth and to practice   and improve those arts which tend to increase our comforts. The assurances,   indeed, of friendly disposition, received from all the powers with whom we have   principal relations, had inspired a confidence that our peace with them would   not have been disturbed. But a cessation of the irregularities which had effected   the commerce of neutral nations, and of the irritations and injuries produced   by them, cannot but add to this confidence; and strengthens, at the same time,   the hope, that wrongs committed on offending friends, under a pressure of circumstances,   will now be reviewed with candor, and will be considered as founding just claims   of retribution for the past and new assurances for the future.Among our Indian neighbors, also, a spirit of peace and friendship generally   prevailing and I am happy to inform you that the continued efforts to introduce   among them the implements and the practice of husbandry, and of the household   arts, have not been without success; that they are becoming more and more sensible   of the superiority of this dependence for clothing and subsistence over the   precarious resources of hunting and fishing; and already we are able to announce,   that instead of that constant diminution of their numbers, produced by their   wars and their wants, some of them begin to experience an increase of population.To this state of general peace with which we have been blessed, one only exception   exists. Tripoli, the least considerable of the Barbary States, had come forward   with demands unfounded either in right or in compact, and had permitted itself   to denounce war, on our failure to comply before a given day. The style of the   demand admitted but one answer. I sent a small squadron of frigates into the   Mediterranean, with assurances to that power of our sincere desire to remain   in peace, but with orders to protect our commerce against the threatened attack.   The measure was seasonable and salutary. The bey had already declared war in   form. His cruisers were out. Two had arrived at Gibraltar. Our commerce in the   Mediterranean was blockaded, and that of the Atlantic in peril. The arrival   of our squadron dispelled the danger. One of the Tripolitan cruisers having   fallen in with, and engaged the small schooner Enterprise, commanded by Lieutenant   Sterret, which had gone as a tender to our larger vessels, was captured, after   a heavy slaughter of her men, without the loss of a single one on our part.   The bravery exhibited by our citizens on that element, will, I trust, be a testimony   to the world that it is not the want of that virtue which makes us seek their   peace, but a conscientious desire to direct the energies of our nation to the   multiplication of the human race, and not to its destruction. Unauthorized by   the constitution, without the sanction of Congress, to go out beyond the line   of defence, the vessel being disabled from committing further hostilities, was   liberated with its crew. The legislature will doubtless consider whether, by   authorizing measures of offence, also, they will place our force on an equal   footing with that of its adversaries. I communicate all material information   on this subject, that in the exercise of the important function considered by   the constitution to the legislature exclusively, their judgment may form itself   on a knowledge and consideration of every circumstance of weight.I wish I could say that our situation with all the other Barbary states was   entirely satisfactory. Discovering that some delays had taken place in the performance   of certain articles stipulated by us, I thought it my duty, by immediate measures   for fulfilling them, to vindicate to ourselves the right of considering the   effect of departure from stipulation on their side. From the papers which will   be laid before you, you will be enabled to judge whether our treaties are regarded   by them as fixing at all the measure of their demands, or as guarding from the   exercise of force our vessels within their power; and to consider how far it   will be safe and expedient to leave our affairs with them in their present posture.I lay before you the result of the census lately taken of our inhabitants,   to a conformity with which we are to reduce the ensuing rates of representation   and taxation. You will perceive that the increase of numbers during the last   ten years, proceeding in geometrical ratio, promises a duplication in little   more than twenty-two years. We contemplate this rapid growth, and the prospect   it holds up to us, not with a view to the injuries it may enable us to do to   others in some future day, but to the settlement of the extensive country still   remaining vacant within our limits, to the multiplications of men susceptible   of happiness, educated in the love of order, habituated to self-government,   and value its blessings above all price.Other circumstances, combined with the increase of numbers, have produced an   augmentation of revenue arising from consumption, in a ratio far beyond that   of population alone, and though the changes of foreign relations now taking   place so desirably for the world, may for a season affect this branch of revenue,   yet, weighing all probabilities of expense, as well as of income, there is reasonable   ground of confidence that we may now safely dispense with all the internal taxes,   comprehending excises, stamps, auctions, licenses, carriages, and refined sugars,   to which the postage on newspapers may be added, to facilitate the progress   of information, and that the remaining sources of revenue will be sufficient   to provide for the support of government to pay the interest on the public debts,   and to discharge the principals in shorter periods than the laws or the general   expectations had contemplated. War, indeed, and untoward events, may change   this prospect of things, and call for expenses which the imposts could not meet;   but sound principles will not justify our taxing the industry of our fellow   citizens to accumulate treasure for wars to happen we know not when, and which   might not perhaps happen but from the temptations offered by that treasure.These views, however, of reducing our burdens, are formed on the expectation   that a sensible, and at the same time a salutary reduction, may take place in   our habitual expenditures. For this purpose, those of the civil government,   the army, and navy, will need revisal.When we consider that this government is charged with the external and mutual   relations only of these states; that the states themselves have principal care   of our persons, our property, and our reputation, constituting the great field   of human concerns, we may well doubt whether our organization is not too complicated,   too expensive; whether offices or officers have not been multiplied unnecessarily,   and sometimes injuriously to the service they were meant to promote. I will   cause to be laid before you an essay toward a statement of those who, under   public employment of various kinds, draw money from the treasury or from our   citizens. Time has not permitted a perfect enumeration, the ramifications of   office being too multipled and remote to be completely traced in a first trial.   Among those who are dependent on executive discretion, I have begun the reduction   of what was deemed necessary. The expenses of diplomatic agency have been considerably   diminished. The inspectors of internal revenue who were found to obstruct the   accountability of the institution, have been discontinued. Several agencies   created by executive authority, on salaries fixed by that also, have been suppressed,   and should suggest the expediency of regulating that power by law, so as to   subject its exercises to legislative inspection and sanction. Other reformations   of the same kind will be pursued with that caution which is requisite in removing   useless things, not to injure what is retained. But the great mass of public   offices is established by law, and, therefore, by law alone can be abolished.   Should the legislature think it expedient to pass this roll in review, and try   all its parts by the test of public utility, they may be assured of every aid   and light which executive information can yield. Considering the general tendency   to multiply offices and dependencies, and to increase expense to the ultimate   term of burden which the citizen can bear, it behooves us to avail ourselves   of every occasion which presents itself for taking off the surcharge; that it   may never be seen here that, after leaving to labor the smallest portion of   its earnings on which it can subsist, government shall itself consume the residue   of what it was instituted to guard.In our care, too, of the public contributions intrusted to our direction, it   would be prudent to multiply barriers against their dissipation, by appropriating   specific sums to every specific purpose susceptible of definition; by disallowing   applications of money varying from the appropriation in object, or transcending   it in amount; by reducing the undefined field of contingencies, and thereby   circumscribing discretionary powers over money; and by bringing back to a single   department all accountabilities for money where the examination may be prompt,   efficacious, and uniform.An account of the receipts and expenditures of the last year, as prepared by   the secretary of the treasury, will as usual be laid before you. The success   which has attended the late sales of the public lands, shows that with attention   they may be made an important source of receipt. Among the payments, those made   in discharge of the principal and interest of the national debt, will show that   the public faith has been exactly maintained. To these will be added an estimate   of appropriations necessary for the ensuing year. This last will of course be   effected by such modifications of the systems of expense, as you shall think   proper to adopt.A statement has been formed by the secretary of war, on mature consideration,   of all the posts and stations where garrisons will be expedient, and of the   number of men requisite for each garrison. The whole amount is considerably   short of the present military establishment. For the surplus no particular use   can be pointed out. For defence against invasion, their number is as nothing;   nor is it conceived needful or safe that a standing army should be kept up in   time of peace for that purpose. Uncertain as we must ever be of the particular   point in our circumference where an enemy may choose to invade us, the only   force which can be ready at every point and competent to oppose them, is the   body of neighboring citizens as formed into a militia. On these, collected from   the parts most convenient, in numbers proportioned to the invading foe, it is   best to rely, not only to meet the first attack, but if it threatens to be permanent,   to maintain the defence until regulars may be engaged to relieve them. These   considerations render it important that we should at every session continue   to amend the defects which from time to time show themselves in the laws for   regulating the militia, until they are sufficiently perfect. Nor should we now   or at any time separate, until we can say we have done everything for the militia   which we could do were an enemy at our door.The provisions of military stores on hand will be laid before you, that you   may judge of the additions still requisite.With respect to the extent to which our naval preparations should be carried,   some difference of opinion may be expected to appear; but just attention to   the circumstances of every part of the Union will doubtless reconcile all. A   small force will probably continue to be wanted for actual service in the Mediterranean.   Whatever annual sum beyond that you may think proper to appropriate to naval   preparations, would perhaps be better employed in providing those articles which   may be kept without waste or consumption, and be in readiness when any exigence   calls them into use. Progress has been made, as will appear by papers now communicated,   in providing materials for seventy-four gun ships as directed by law.How far the authority given by the legislature for procuring and establishing   sites for naval purposes has been perfectly understood and pursued in the execution,   admits of some doubt. A statement of the expenses already incurred on that subject,   shall be laid before you. I have in certain cases suspended or slackened these   expenditures, that the legislature might determine whether so many yards are   necessary as have been contemplated. The works at this place are among those   permitted to go on; and five of the seven frigates directed to be laid up, have   been brought and laid up here, where, besides the safety of their position,   they are under the eye of the executive administration, as well as of its agents   and where yourselves also will be guided by your own view in the legislative   provisions respecting them which may from time to time be necessary. They are   preserved in such condition, as well the vessels as whatever belongs to them,   as to be at all times ready for sea on a short warning. Two others are yet to   be laid up so soon as they shall have reserved the repairs requisite to put   them also into sound condition. As a superintending officer will be necessary   at each yard, his duties and emoluments, hitherto fixed by the executive, will   be a more proper subject for legislation. A communication will also be made   of our progress in the execution of the law respecting the vessels directed   to be sold.The fortifications of our harbors, more or less advanced, present considerations   of great difficulty. While some of them are on a scale sufficiently proportioned   to the advantages of their position, to the efficacy of their protection, and   the importance of the points within it, others are so extensive, will cost so   much in their first erection, so much in their maintenance, and require such   a force to garrison them, as to make it questionable what is best now to be   done. A statement of those commenced or projected, of the expenses already incurred,   and estimates of their future cost, so far as can be foreseen, shall be laid   before you, that you may be enabled to judge whether any attention is necessary   in the laws respecting this subject.Agriculture, manufactures, commerce, and navigation, the four pillars of our   prosperity, are the most thriving when left most free to individual enterprise.   Protection from casual embarrassments, however, may sometimes be seasonably   interposed. If in the course of your observations or inquiries they should appear   to need any aid within the limits of our constitutional powers, your sense of   their importance is a sufficient assurance they will occupy your attention.   We cannot, indeed, but all feel an anxious solicitude for the difficulties under   which our carrying trade will soon be placed. How far it can be relieved, otherwise   than by time, is a subject of important consideration.The judiciary system of the United States, and especially that portion of it   recently erected, will of course present itself to the contemplation of Congress:   and that they may be able to judge of the proportion which the institution bears   to the business it has to perform, I have caused to be procured from the several   States, and now lay before Congress, an exact statement of all the causes decided   since the first establishment of the courts, and of those which were depending   when additional courts and judges were brought in to their aid.And while on the judiciary organization, it will be worthy your consideration,   whether the protection of the inestimable institution of juries has been extended   to all the cases involving the security of our persons and property. Their impartial   selection also being essential to their value, we ought further to consider   whether that is sufficiently secured in those States where they are named by   a marshal depending on executive will, or designated by the court or by officers   dependent on them.I cannot omit recommending a revisal of the laws on the subject of naturalization.   Considering the ordinary chances of human life, a denial of citizenship under   a residence of fourteen years is a denial to a great proportion of those who   ask it, and controls a policy pursued from their first settlement by many of   these States, and still believed of consequence to their prosperity. And shall   we refuse the unhappy fugitives from distress that hospitality which the savages   of the wilderness extended to our fathers arriving in this land? Shall oppressed   humanity find no asylum on this globe? The constitution, indeed, has wisely   provided that, for admission to certain offices of important trust, a residence   shall be required sufficient to develop character and design. But might not   the general character and capabilities of a citizen be safely communicated to   every one manifesting a _bona fide_ purpose of embarking his life and fortunes   permanently with us? with restrictions, perhaps, to guard against the fraudulent   usurpation of our flag; an abuse which brings so much embarrassment and loss   on the genuine citizen, and so much danger to the nation of being involved in   war, that no endeavor should be spared to detect and suppress it.These, fellow citizens, are the matters respecting the state of the nation,   which I have thought of importance to be submitted to your consideration at   this time. Some others of less moment, or not yet ready for communication, will   be the subject of separate messages. I am happy in this opportunity of committing   the arduous affairs of our government to the collected wisdom of the Union.   Nothing shall be wanting on my part to inform, as far as in my power, the legislative   judgment, nor to carry that judgment into faithful execution. The prudence and   temperance of your discussions will promote, within your own walls, that conciliation   which so much befriends national conclusion; and by its example will encourage   among our constituents that progress of opinion which is tending to unite them   in object and in will. That all should be satisfied with any one order of things   is not to be expected, but I indulge the pleasing persuasion that the great   body of our citizens will cordially concur in honest and disinterested efforts,   which have for their object to preserve the general and State governments in   their constitutional form and equilibrium; to maintain peace abroad, and order   and obedience to the laws at home; to establish principles and practices of   administration favorable to the security of liberty and prosperity, and to reduce   expenses to what is necessary for the useful purposes of government.  GENTLEMAN,  The affectionate sentiments of esteem and approbation which you are so good   as to express towards me, on behalf of the Danbury Baptist Association, give   me the highest satisfaction. My duties dictate a faithful and zealous pursuit   of the interests of my constituents, and in proportion as they are persuaded   of my fidelity to those duties, the discharge of them becomes more and more   pleasing.  Believing with you that religion is a matter which lies solely between man   and his God, that he owes account to none other for his faith or his worship,   that the legislative powers of government reach actions only, and not opinions,   I contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people   which declared that their legislature should "make no law respecting an   establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof," thus   building a wall of separation between church and State. Adhering to this expression   of the supreme will of the nation in behalf of the rights of conscience, I shall   see with sincere satisfaction the progress of those sentiments which tend to   restore to man all his natural rights, convinced he has no natural right in   opposition to his social duties.  I reciprocate your kind prayers for the protection and blessing of the common   Father and Creator of man, and tender you for yourselves and your religious   association, assurances of my high respect and esteem. TO BROTHER HANDSOME LAKE:          I have received the message in writing which you sent me through Captain Irvine,   our confidential agent, placed near you for the purpose of communicating and   transacting between us, whatever may be useful for both nations. I am happy   to learn you have been so far favored by the Divine spirit as to be made sensible   of those things which are for your good and that of your people, and of those   which are hurtful to you; and particularly that you and they see the ruinous   effects which the abuse of spirituous liquors have produced upon them. It has   weakened their bodies, enervated their minds, exposed them to hunger, cold,   nakedness, and poverty, kept them in perpetual broils, and reduced their population.   I do not wonder then, brother, at your censures, not only on your own people,   who have voluntarily gone into these fatal habits, but on all the nations of   white people who have supplied their calls for this article. But these nations   have done to you only what they do among themselves. They have sold what individuals   wish to buy, leaving to every one to be the guardian of his own health and happiness.   Spirituous liquors are not in themselves bad, they are often found to be an   excellent medicine for the sick; it is the improper and intemperate use of them,   by those in health, which makes them injurious. But as you find that your people   cannot refrain from an ill use of them, I greatly applaud your resolution not   to use them at all. We have too affectionate a concern for your happiness to   place the paltry gain on the sale of these articles in competition with the   injury they do you. And as it is the desire of your nation, that no spirits   should be sent among them, I am authorized by the great council of the United   States to prohibit them. I will sincerely cooperate with your wise men in any   proper measures for this purpose, which shall be agreeable to them. You remind me, brother, of what I said to you, when you visited me the last   winter, that the lands you then held would remain yours, and shall never go   from you but when you should be disposed to sell. This I now repeat, and will   ever abide by. We, indeed, are always ready to buy land; but we will never ask   but when you wish to sell; and our laws, in order to protect you against imposition,   have forbidden individuals to purchase lands from you; and have rendered it   necessary, when you desire to sell, even to a State, that an agent from the   United States should attend the sale, see that your consent is freely given,   a satisfactory price paid, and report to us what has been done, for our approbation.   This was done in the late case of which you complain. The deputies of your nation   came forward, in all the forms which we have been used to consider as evidence   of the will of your nation. They proposed to sell to the State of New York certain   parcels of land, of small extent, and detached from the body of your other lands;   the State of New York was desirous to buy. I sent an agent, in whom we could   trust, to see that your consent was free, and the sale fair. All was reported   to be free and fair. The lands were your property. The right to sell is one   of the rights of property. To forbid you the exercise of that right would be   a wrong to your nation. Nor do I think, brother, that the sale of lands is,   under all circumstances, injurious to your people. While they depended on hunting,   the more extensive the forest around them, the more game they would yield. But   going into a state of agriculture, it may be as advantageous to a society, as   it is to an individual, who has more land than he can improve, to sell a part,   and lay out the money in stocks and implements of agriculture, for the better   improvement of the residue. A little land well stocked and improved, will yield   more than a great deal without stock or improvement. I hope, therefore, that   on further reflection, you will see this transaction in a more favorable light,   both as it concerns the interest of your nation, and the exercise of that superintending   care which I am sincerely anxious to employ for their subsistence and happiness.   Go on then, brother, in the great reformation you have undertaken. Persuade   our red brethren then to be sober, and to cultivate their lands; and their women   to spin and weave for their families. You will soon see your women and children   well fed and clothed, your men living happily in peace and plenty, and your   numbers increasing from year to year. It will be a great glory to you to have   been the instrument of so happy a change, and your children's children, from   generation to generation, will repeat your name with love and gratitude forever.   In all your enterprises for the good of your people, you may count with confidence   on the aid and protection of the United States, and on the sincerity and zeal   with which I am myself animated in the furthering of this humane work. You are   our brethren of the same land; we wish your prosperity as brethren should do.   Farewell. To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States:When we assemble together, fellow citizens, to consider the state of our beloved    country, our just attentions are first drawn to those pleasing circumstances    which mark the goodness of that Being from whose favor they flow and the large    measure of thankfulness we owe for His bounty. Another year has come around,    and finds us still blessed with peace and friendship abroad; law, order, and    religion at home; good affection and harmony with our Indian neighbors; our    burthens lightened, yet our income sufficient for the public wants, and the    produce of the year great beyond example. These, fellow citizens, are the circumstances    under which we meet, and we remark with special satisfaction those which under    the smiles of Providence result from the skill, industry, and order of our citizens,    managing their own affairs in their own way and for their own use, unembarrassed    by too much regulation, unoppressed by fiscal exactions.On the restoration of peace in Europe that portion of the general carrying    trade which had fallen to our share during the war was abridged by the returning    competition of the belligerent powers. This was to be expected, and was just.    But in addition we find in some parts of Europe monopolizing discriminations,    which in the form of duties tend effectually to prohibit the carrying thither    our own produce in our own vessels. From existing amities and a spirit of justice    it is hope that friendly discussion will produce a fair and adequate reciprocity.    But should false calculations of interest defeat our hope, it rests with the legislature to decide whether they will meet inequalities abroad with countervailing    inequalities at home, or provide for the evil in any other way.It is with satisfaction I lay before you an act of the British Parliament anticipating    this subject so far as to authorize a mutual abolition of the duties and countervailing    duties permitted under the treaty of 1794. It shows on their part a spirit of    justice and friendly accommodation which it is our duty and our interest to    cultivate with all nations. Whether this would produce a due equality in the    navigation between the two countries is a subject for your consideration.Another circumstances which claims attention as directly affecting the very    source of our navigation in the defect or the evasion of the law providing for    the return of seamen, and particularly of those belonging to vessels sold abroad.    Numbers of them, discharged in foreign ports, have dangers into which their    distresses might plunge them and save them to their country, have found it necessary    in some cases to return them at the public charge.The cession of the Spanish Province of Louisiana to France, which took place    in the course of the late war, will if carried into effect, make a change in    the aspect of our foreign relations which will doubtless have just weight in    any deliberations of the legislature connected with that subject.There was reason not long since to apprehend that the warfare in which we were    engaged with Tripoli might be taken up by some other of the Barbary Powers.    A reenforcement, therefore, was immediately ordered to the vessels already there.    Subsequent information, however has removed these apprehensions for the present.    To secure our commerce in that sea with the smallest force competent, we have    supposed it best to watch strictly the harbor of Tripoli. Still, however, the    shallowness of their coast and the want of smaller vessels on our part has permitted    some cruisers to escape unobserved, and to one of these an American vessel unfortunately    fell a prey. The captain, one American seaman, and two others of color remain    prisoners with them unless exchanged under an agreement formerly made with the    Bashaw, to whom, on the faith of that, some of his captive subjects had been    restored.The convention with the state of Georgia has been ratified by their legislature,    and a repurchase from the Creeks has been consequently made of a part of the    Talasscee country. In this purchase has been also comprehended a part of the    lands within the fork of Oconee and Oakmulgee rivers. The particulars of the    contract will be laid before Congress so soon as they shall be in a state for    communication.In order to remove every ground of difference possible with our Indian neighbors,    I have proceeded in the work of settling with them and marking the boundaries    between us. That with Choctaw Nation is fixed in one part and will be through    the whole within a short time. The country to which their title had been extinguished    before the Revolution is sufficient to receive a very respectful population,    which Congress will probably see the expediency of encouraging so soon as the    limits shall be declared. We are to view this position as an outpost of the    United States, surrounded by strong neighbors and distant from its support;    and how far that monopoly which prevents population should here be guarded against    and actual habitation made a condition of the continuance of title will be for    your consideration. A prompt settlement, too, of all existing rights and claims    within this territory presents itself as a preliminary operation.In that part of the Indian Territory which includes Vicennes the lines settled    with neighboring tribes fix the extinction of their title at a breadth of 24    leagues from east to west and about the same length parallel with and including    the Wabash. They have also ceded a tract of four miles square, including the salt    springs near the mouth of that river.In the Department of Finance it is with pleasure I inform you that the receipts    of external duties for the last twelve months have exceeded those of any former    year, and that the ratio of increase has been also greater than usual. This    has enabled us to answer all the regular exigencies of government, to pay from    the Treasury within one year upward of $8,000,000, principal and interest, of    the public debt, exclusive of upward of one million paid by the sale of bank    stock, and making in the whole a reduction of nearly five millions and a half    of principal, and to have now in the Treasury $4,500,000, which are in a course    of application to the further discharge of debt and current demands. Experience,    too, so far, authorizes us to believe, if no extraordinary event supervenes,    and the expenses which will be actually incurred shall not be greater than were    contemplated by Congress at their last session, that we shall not be disappointed    in the expectations then formed. But nevertheless, as the effect of peace on    the amount of duties is not yet fully ascertained, it is the more necessary    to practice every useful economy and to incur no expense which may be avoided    without prejudice.The collection of the internal taxes having been retarded, it will be some    time before the system is closed. It is not yet been thought necessary to employ    the agent authorized by an act of the last session for transacting business    in Europe relative to debts and loans. Nor have we used the power confided by    the same act of prolonging the foreign debt by reloans, and of redeeming instead    thereof an equal sum of domestic debt. Should, however, the difficulties of    remittance on so large a scale render it necessary at any time, the power shall    be executed and the money thus unemployed abroad shall, in conformity with that    law, be faithfully applied here in equivalent extinction of domestic debt. When    effects do salutary result from the plans you have already sanctioned; when    merely by avoiding false objects of expense we are able, without a direct tax,    without internal taxes, and without borrowing to make large and effectual payments    toward the discharge of public debt and the emancipation of our posterity from    that mortal canker, it is an encouragement, fellow citizens, of the highest    order to proceed as we have begun in substituting economy for taxation, and    in pursuing what is useful for a nation placed as we are, rather than what is    practiced by others under different circumstances. And whensoever we are destined    to meet events which shall call forth all the energies of our countryman, we    have the firmest reliance on those energies and the comfort of leaving for calls    like these the extraordinary resources of loans and internal taxes. In the meantime,    by payments of the principal of our debt, we are liberating annually portions    of the external taxes and forming from them a growing fund still further to    lessen the necessity of recurring to extraordinary resources.The usual account of receipts and expenditures for the last year, with an estimate    of the expenses of the ensuing one, will be laid before you by the Secretary    of Treasury.No change being deemed necessary in our military establishment, an estimate    of its expenses for the ensuing year on its present footing, as also sums to    be employed in fornications and other objects within that department, has been    prepared by the Secretary of War, and will make a part of the general estimates    which will be presented you.Considering that our regular troops are employed for local purposes, and that    the militia our general reliance for great and sudden emergencies, you will    doubtless think this institution worth of a review, and give those improvements    of which you find susceptible.Estimates for the Naval Department, prepared by the Secretary of the Navy,    for another year will in like manner be communicated with general estimates.    A small force in the Mediterranean will still be necessary to restrain the Tripoline    cruisers, and the uncertain tenure of peace with some other of the Barbary Powers    may eventually require that force to be augmented. The necessity of procuring    some smaller vessels for that service will raise the estimate, but the difference    in their maintenance will soon make it a measure of economy.Presuming it will be deemed expedient to expend annually a convenient sum toward    providing the naval defense which our situation may require. I can not but recommend    that the first appropriations for that purpose may go to the saving what we    already possess. No cares, no attentions, can preserve vessels from rapid decay    which lie in water exposed to the sun. These decays require great and constant    repairs and will consume, if continues, a great portion of the moneys destined    to naval purposes. To avoid this waste of our resources it is proposed to add    to our navy yard here a dock within which our present vessels may be laid up    dry and cover from the sun. Under these circumstances experience proves that    works of wood will remain scarcely at all affected by time. The great abundance    of running water which this situation possess, at heights far above the level    of the tide, if employed as is practiced for lock navigation, furnishes the    means for raising and laying up our vessels on a dry and sheltered bed. And    should the measure be found useful here, similar depositories for laying up    as well as for building and repairing vessel may hereafter be undertaken at    other navy yards offering the same means. The plans and estimates of the work,    prepared by a person of skill and experience, will be presented to you without    delay, and from this it will be seen that scarcely more than has been the cost    of one vessel is necessary to save the whole, and that the annual sum to be    employed toward its completion may be adapted to the views of the legislature    as to naval expenditure.To cultivate peace and maintain commerce and navigation in all their lawful    enterprises; to foster our fisheries as nurseries of navigation and for the    nurture of man, and protect the manufactures adapted to our circumstances;    to preserve the faith of the nation by an exact discharge of its debts and contracts,    expend the public money with same care and economy we would practice with our    own, and impose on our citizens no unnecessary burthens; to keep in all of safety—these,    fellow citizens, are the landmarks by which we are to guide ourselves in all    our proceedings. By continuing to make these the rule of our action we shall    endear to our countrymen the true principles of their Constitution and promote    an union of sentiment an of action equally auspicious to their happiness and    safety. On my part, you may count on a cordial concurrence in every measure    for the public good and on all the information I possess which may enable you    to discharge to advantage the high functions with which you are invested by    your country. Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives: As the continuance of the act for establishing trading houses with the Indian tribes will be under the consideration of the Legislature at its present session, I think it my duty to communicate the views which have guided me in the execution of that act, in order that you may decide on the policy of continuing it in the present or any other form, or discontinue it altogether if that shall, on the whole, seem most for the public good.The Indian tribes residing within the limits of the United States have for a considerable time been growing more and more uneasy at the constant diminution of the territory they occupy, although effected by their own voluntary sales, and the policy has long been gaining strength with them of refusing absolutely all further sale on any conditions, insomuch that at this time it hazards their friendship and excites dangerous jealousies and perturbations in their minds to make any overture for the purchase of the smallest portions of their land. A very few tribes only are not yet obstinately in these dispositions. In order peaceably to counteract this policy of theirs and to provide an extension of territory which the rapid increase of our numbers will call for, two measures are deemed expedient. First. To encourage them to abandon hunting, to apply to the raising stock, to agriculture, and domestic manufacture, and thereby prove to themselves that less land and labor will maintain them in this better than in their former mode of living. The extensive forests necessary in the hunting life will then become useless, and they will see advantage in exchanging them for the means of improving their farms and of increasing their domestic comforts. Secondly. To multiply trading houses among them, and place within their reach those things which will contribute more to their domestic comfort than the possession of extensive but uncultivated wilds. Experience and reflection will develop to them the wisdom of exchanging what they can spare and we want for what we can spare and they want. In leading them thus to agriculture, to factures, and civilization; in bringing together their and our sentiments, and in preparing them ultimately to participate in the benefits of our Government, I trust and believe we are acting for their greatest good. At these trading houses we have pursued the principles of the act of Congress which directs that the commerce shall be carried on liberally, and requires only that the capital stock shall not be diminished. We consequently undersell private traders, foreign and domestic, drive them from the competition, and thus, with the good will of the Indians, rid ourselves of a description of men who are constantly endeavoring to excite in the Indian mind suspicions, fears, and irritations toward us. A letter now inclosed shows the effect of our competition on the operations of the traders, while the Indians, perceiving the advantage of purchasing from us, are soliciting generally our establishment of trading houses among them. In one quarter this is particularly interesting. The Legislature, reflecting on the late occurrences on the Mississippi, must be sensible how desirable it is to possess a respectable breadth of country on that river, from our southern limit to the Illinois, at least, so that we may present as firm a front on that as on our eastern border. We possess what is below the Yazoo, and can probably acquire a certain breadth from the Illinois and Wabash to the Ohio; but between the Ohio and Yazoo the country all belongs to the Chickasaws, the most friendly tribe within our limits, but the most decided against the alienation of lands. The portion of their country most important for us is exactly that which they do not inhabit. Their settlements are not on the Mississippi, but in the interior country. They have lately shown a desire to become agricultural, and this leads to the desire of buying implements and comforts. In the strengthening and gratifying of these wants I see the only prospect of planting on the Mississippi itself the means of its own safety. Duty has required me to submit these views to the judgment of the Legislature, but as their disclosure might embarrass and defeat their effect, they are committed to the special confidence of the two Houses.While the extension of the public commerce among the Indian tribes may deprive of that source of profit such of our citizens as are engaged in it, it might be worthy the attention of Congress in their care of individual as well as of the general interest to point in another direction the enterprise of these citizens, as profitably for themselves and more usefully for the public. The river Missouri and the Indians inhabiting it are not as well known as is rendered desirable by their connection with the Mississippi, and consequently with us. It is, however, understood that the country on that river is inhabited by numerous tribes, who furnish great supplies of furs and peltry to the trade of another nation, carried on in a high latitude through an infinite number of portages and lakes shut up by ice through a long season. The commerce on that line could bear no competition with that of the Missouri, traversing a moderate climate, offering, according to the best accounts, a continued navigation from its source, and possibly with a single portage from the Western Ocean, and finding to the Atlantic a choice of channels through the Illinois or Wabash, the Lakes and Hudson, through the Ohio and Susquehanna, or Potomac or James rivers, and through the Tennessee and Savannah rivers. An intelligent officer, with ten or twelve chosen men, fit for the enterprise and willing to undertake it, taken from our posts where they may be spared without inconvenience, might explore the whole line, even to the Western Ocean, have conferences with the natives on the subject of commercial intercourse, get admission among them for our traders as others are admitted, agree on convenient deposits for an interchange of articles, and return with the information acquired in the course of two summers. Their arms and accouterments, some instruments of observation, and light and cheap presents for the Indians would be all the apparatus they could carry, and with an expectation of a soldier's portion of land on their return would constitute the whole expense. Their pay would be going on whether here or there. While other civilized nations have encountered great expense to enlarge the boundaries of knowledge by undertaking voyages of discovery, and for other literary purposes, in various parts and directions, our nation seems to owe to the same object, as well as to its own interests, to explore this the only line of easy communication across the continent, and so directly traversing our own part of it. The interests of commerce place the principal object within the constitutional powers and care of Congress, and that it should incidentally advance the geographical knowledge of our own continent can not but be an additional gratification. The nation claiming the territory, regarding this as a literary pursuit, which it is in the habit of permitting within its dominions, would not be disposed to view it with jealousy, even if the expiring state of its interests there did not render it a matter of indifference. The appropriation of $2, 500 "for the purpose of extending the external commerce of the United States," while understood and considered by the Executive as giving the legislative sanction, would cover the undertaking from notice and prevent the obstructions which interested individuals might otherwise previously prepare in its way.TH: JEFFERSON.To Meriwether Lewis esq. Capt. of the 1st regimt. of infantry   of the U. S. of A.:Your situation as Secretary of the President of the U. S. has made you acquainted   with the objects of my confidential message of Jan. 18, 1803 to the legislature;   you have seen the act they passed, which, tho' expressed in general terms, was   meant to sanction those objects, and you are appointed to carry them into execution. Instruments for ascertaining, by celestial observations, the geography of the   country through which you will pass, have been already provided. Light articles   for barter and presents among the Indians, arms for your attendants, say for   from 10. to 12. men, boats, tents, & other travelling apparatus, with ammunition,   medecine, surgical instruments and provisions you will have prepared with such   aids as the Secretary at War can yield in his department; & from him also   you will recieve authority to engage among our troops, by voluntary agreement,   the number of attendants above mentioned, over whom you, as their commanding   officer, are invested with all the powers the laws give in such a case.As your movements while within the limits of the U.S. will be better directed   by occasional communications, adapted to circumstances as they arise, they will   not be noticed here. What follows will respect your proceedings after your departure   from the United states.Your mission has been communicated to the ministers here from France, Spain   & Great Britain, and through them to their governments; & such assurances   given them as to its objects, as we trust will satisfy them. The country [of   Louisiana] having been ceded by Spain to France, the passport you have from   the minister of France, the representative of the present sovereign of the country,   will be a protection with all its subjects; & that from the minister of   England will entitle you to the friendly aid of any traders of that allegiance   with whom you may happen to meet. The object of your mission is to explore the Missouri river, & such principal   stream of it, as, by it's course & communication with the waters of the   Pacific Ocean, whether the Columbia, Oregan, Colorado or and other river may   offer the most direct & practicable water communication across this continent,   for the purposes of commerce. Beginning at the mouth of the Missouri, you will take careful observations   of latitude & longitude, at all remarkeable points on the river, & especially   at the mouths of rivers, at rapids, at islands, & other places & objects   distinguished by such natural marks & characters of a durable kind, as that   they may with certainty be recognised hereafter. The courses of the river between   these points of observation may be supplied by the compass the log-line &   by time, corrected by the observations themselves. The variations of the compass   too, in different places, should be noticed.The interesting points of the portage between the heads of the Missouri, &   of the water offering the best communication with the Pacific ocean, should   also be fixed by observation, & the course of that water to the ocean, in   the same manner as that of the Missouri. Your observations are to be taken with great pains & accuracy, to be entered   distinctly & intelligibly for others as well as yourself, to comprehend   all the elements necessary, with the aid of the usual tables, to fix the latitude   and longitude of the places at which they were taken, and are to be rendered   to the war-office, for the purpose of having the calculations made concurrently   by proper persons within the U.S. Several copies of these as well as of your   other notes should be made at leisure times, & put into the care of the   most trustworthy of your attendants, to guard, by multiplying them, against   the accidental losses to which they will be exposed. A further guard would be   that one of these copies be on the paper of the birch, as less liable to injury   from damp than common paper. The commerce which may be carried on with the people inhabiting the line you   will pursue, renders a knolege of those people important. You will therefore   endeavor to make yourself acquainted, as far as a diligent pursuit of your journey   shall admit, with the names of the nations & their numbers;the extent & limits of their possessions; their relations with other tribes   of nations; their language, traditions, monuments  their ordinary occupations in agriculture, fishing, hunting, war, arts, &   the implements for these;   their food, clothing, & domestic accommodations;   the diseases prevalent among them, & the remedies they use;   moral & physical circumstances which distinguish them from the tribes we   know; peculiarities in their laws, customs & dispositions;   and articles of commerce they may need or furnish, & to what extent. And, considering the interest which every nation has in extending & strengthening   the authority of reason & justice among the people around them, it will   be useful to acquire what knolege you can of the state of morality, religion,   & information among them; as it may better enable those who endeavor to   civilize & instruct them, to adapt their measure to the existing notions   & practices of those on whom they are to operate.Other objects worthy of notice will be   the soil & face of the country, it's growth & vegetable productions,   especially those not of the U.S.   the animals of the country generally, & especially those not known in the   U.S. the remains or accounts of any which may be deemed rare or extinct; the   mineral productions of every kind; but more particularly metals, limestone,   pit coal, & saltpetre; salines & mineral waters, noting the temperature   of the last, & such circumstances as may indicate their character;  volcanic appearances;   climate, as characterized by the thermometer, by the proportion of rainy, cloudy,   & clear days, by lightening, hail, snow, ice, by the access & recess   of frost, by the winds prevailing at different seasons, the dates at which particular   plants put forth or lose their flower, or leaf, times of appearance of particular   birds, reptiles or insects. Altho' your route will be along the channel of the Missouri, yet you will endeavor   to inform yourself, by enquiry, of the character & extent of the country   watered by it's branches, & especially on it's Southern side. The North   river or Rio Bravo which runs into the gulph of Mexico, and the North river,   or Rio colorado which runs into the gulph of California, are understood to be   the principal streams heading opposite to the waters of the Missouri, and running   Southwardly. Whether the dividing grounds between the Missouri & them are   mountains or flatlands, what are their distance from the Missouri, the character   of the intermediate country, & the people inhabiting it, are worthy of particular   enquiry. The Northern waters of the Missouri are less to be enquired after,   becaue they have been ascertained to a considerable degree, & are still   in a course of ascertainment by English traders, and travellers. But if you   can learn any thing certain of the most Northern source of the Missisipi, &   of its position relatively to the lake of the woods, it will be interesting   to us. Some account too of the path of the Canadian traders from the Missisipi, at   the mouth of the Ouisconsin to where it strikes the Missouri, & of the soil   and rivers in it's course, is desireable.In all your intercourse with the natives, treat them in the most friendly &   conciliatory manner which their own conduct will admit; allay all jealousies   as to the object of your journey, satisfy them of its innocence, make them acquainted   with the position, extent, character, peaceable & commercial dispositions   of the U.S. of our wish to be neighborly, friendly & useful to them, &   of our dispositions to a commercial intercourse with them; confer with them   on the points most convenient as mutual emporiums, and the articles of most   desireable interchange for them & us. If a few of their influential chiefs,   within practicable distance, wish to visit us, arrange such a visit with them,   and furnish them with authority to call on our officers, on their entering the   U.S to have them conveyed to this place at the public expense. If any of them   should wish to have some of their young people brought up with us, & taught   such arts as may be useful to them, we will receive, instruct & take care   of them. Such a mission, whether of influential chiefs or of young people, would   give some security to your own party. Carry with you some matter of the kinepox;   inform those of them with whom you may be, of it'[s] efficacy as a preservative   from the small-pox; & instruct & incourage them in the use of it. This   may be especially done wherever you winter. As it is impossible for us to foresee in what manner you will be recieved by   those people, whether with hospitality or hostility, so is it impossible to   prescribe the exact degree of perseverance with which you are to pursue your   journey. We value too much the lives of citizens to offer them to probable destruction.   Your numbers will be sufficient to secure you against the unauthorised opposition   of individuals or of small parties: but if a superior force, authorised, or   not authorised, by a nation, should be arrayed against your further passage,   and inflexibly determined to arrest it, you must decline its further pursuit,   and return. In the loss of yourselves, we should lose also the information you   will have acquired. By returning safely with that, you may enable us to renew   the essay with better calculated means. To your own discretion therefore must   be left the degree of danger you may risk, and the point at which you should   decline, only saying we wish you to err on the side of your safety, and to bring   back your party safe even it if be with less information.As far up the Missouri as the white settlements extend, an intercourse will   probably be found to exist between them & the Spanish post of St. Louis   opposite Cahokia, or Ste. Genevieve opposite Kaskaskia. From still further up   the river, the traders may furnish a conveyance for letters. Beyond that, you   may perhaps be able to engage Indian to bring letters for the government to   Cahokia or Kaskaskia, on promising that they shall there receive such special   compensation as you shall have stipulated with them. Avail yourself of these   means to communicate to us, at seasonable intervals, a copy of your journal,   notes & observations, of every kind, putting into cypher whatever might   do injury if betrayed. Should you reach the Pacific ocean inform yourself of the circumstances which   may decide whether the furs of those parts may not be collected as advantageously   at the head of the Missouri (convenient as it supposed to the waters of the   Colorado & Oregan or Columbia) as at Nootka sound, or any other point of   that coast; and that trade be consequently conducted through the Missouri &   U.S. more beneficially than by the circumnavigation now practised. On your arrival on that coast endeavor to learn if there be any port within   your reach frequented by the sea-vessels of any nation, & to send two of   your trusty people back by sea, in such way as shall appear practicable, with   a copy of your notes: and should you be of opinion that the return of your party   by the way they went will be eminently dangerous, then ship the whole, &   return by sea, by way either of cape Horn, or the cape of good Hope, as you   shall be able. As you will be without money, clothes or provisions, you must   endeavor to use the credit of the U.S. to obtain them, for which purpose open   letters of credit shall be furnished you, authorising you to draw upon the Executive   of the U.S. or any of its officers, in any part of the world, on which draughts   can be disposed of, & to apply with our recommendations to the Consuls,   agents, merchants, or citizens of any nation with which we have intercourse,   assuring them, in our name, that any aids they may furnish you, shall be honorably   repaid, and on demand. Our consuls Thomas Hewes at Batavia in Java, Win. Buchanan   in the Isles of France & Bourbon, & John Elmslie at the Cape of good   Hope will be able to supply your necessities by draughts on us.Should you find it safe to return by the way you go, after sending two of your   party around by sea, or with your whole party, if no conveyance by sea can be   found, do so; making such observations on your return, as may serve to supply,   correct or confirm those made on your outward journey. On re-entering the U.S. and reaching a place of safety, discharge any of your   attendants who may desire & deserve it, procuring for them immediate paiment   of all arrears of pay & cloathing which may have incurred since their departure,   and assure them that they shall be recommended to the liberality of the legislature   for the grant of a souldier's portion of land each, as proposed in my message   to Congress: & repair yourself with papers to the seat of government.To provide, on the accident of your death, against anarchy, dispersion, &   the consequent danger to your party, and total failure of the enterprize, you   are hereby authorised, by any instrument signed & written in your own hand,   to name the person among them who shall succeed to the command on your decease,   and by like instruments to change the nomination from time to time as further   experience of the characters accompanying you shall point out superior fitness:   and all the powers and authorities given to yourself are, in the event of your   death, transferred to, & vested in the successor so named, with further   power to him, and his successors in like manner to name each his successor,   who, on the death of his predecessor, shall be invested with all the powers   & authorities given to yourself.  Given under my hand at the city of Washington this 20th day of June 1803.  Th. Jefferson  Pr. U.S. of AmericaTO THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE UNITED STATES:            In calling you together, fellow citizens, at an earlier day than was contemplated   by the act of the last session of Congress, I have not been insensible to the   personal inconveniences necessarily resulting from an unexpected change in your   arrangements. But matters of great public concernment have rendered this call   necessary, and the interest you feel in these will supersede in your minds all   private considerations. Congress witnessed, at their last session, the extraordinary agitation produced   in the public mind by the suspension of our right of deposit at the port of   New Orleans, no assignment of another place having been made according to treaty.   They were sensible that the continuance of that privation would be more injurious   to our nation than any consequences which could flow from any mode of redress,   but reposing just confidence in the good faith of the government whose officer   had committed the wrong, friendly and reasonable representations were resorted   to, and the right of deposit was restored. Previous, however, to this period, we had not been unaware of the danger to   which our peace would be perpetually exposed while so important a key to the   commerce of the western country remained under foreign power. Difficulties,   too, were presenting themselves as to the navigation of other streams, which,   arising within our territories, pass through those adjacent. Propositions had,   therefore, been authorized for obtaining, on fair conditions, the sovereignty   of New Orleans, and of other possessions in that quarter interesting to our   quiet, to such extent as was deemed practicable; and the provisional appropriation   of two millions of dollars, to be applied and accounted for by the president   of the United States, intended as part of the price, was considered as conveying   the sanction of Congress to the acquisition proposed. The enlightened government   of France saw, with just discernment, the importance to both nations of such   liberal arrangements as might best and permanently promote the peace, friendship,   and interests of both; and the property and sovereignty of all Louisiana, which   had been restored to them, have on certain conditions been transferred to the   United States by instruments bearing date the 30th of April last. When these   shall have received the constitutional sanction of the senate, they will without   delay be communicated to the representatives also, for the exercise of their   functions, as to those conditions which are within the powers vested by the   constitution in Congress. While the property and sovereignty of the Mississippi   and its waters secure an independent outlet for the produce of the western States,   and an uncontrolled navigation through their whole course, free from collision   with other powers and the dangers to our peace from that source, the fertility   of the country, its climate and extent, promise in due season important aids   to our treasury, an ample provision for our posterity, and a wide-spread field   for the blessings of freedom and equal laws. With the wisdom of Congress it will rest to take those ulterior measures which   may be necessary for the immediate occupation and temporary government of the   country; for its incorporation into our Union; for rendering the change of government   a blessing to our newly-adopted brethren; for securing to them the rights of   conscience and of property: for confirming to the Indian inhabitants their occupancy   and self-government, establishing friendly and commercial relations with them,   and for ascertaining the geography of the country acquired. Such materials for   your information, relative to its affairs in general, as the short space of   time has permitted me to collect, will be laid before you when the subject shall   be in a state for your consideration. Another important acquisition of territory has also been made since the last   session of Congress. The friendly tribe of Kaskaskia Indians with which we have   never had a difference, reduced by the wars and wants of savage life to a few   individuals unable to defend themselves against the neighboring tribes, has   transferred its country to the United States, reserving only for its members   what is sufficient to maintain them in an agricultural way. The considerations   stipulated are, that we shall extend to them our patronage and protection, and   give them certain annual aids in money, in implements of agriculture, and other   articles of their choice. This country, among the most fertile within our limits,   extending along the Mississippi from the mouth of the Illinois to and up the   Ohio, though not so necessary as a barrier since the acquisition of the other   bank, may yet be well worthy of being laid open to immediate settlement, as   its inhabitants may descend with rapidity in support of the lower country should   future circumstances expose that to foreign enterprise. As the stipulations   in this treaty also involve matters within the competence of both houses only,   it will be laid before Congress as soon as the senate shall have advised its   ratification. With many other Indian tribes, improvements in agriculture and household manufacture   are advancing, and with all our peace and friendship are established on grounds   much firmer than heretofore. The measure adopted of establishing trading houses   among them, and of furnishing them necessaries in exchange for their commodities,   at such moderated prices as leave no gain, but cover us from loss, has the most   conciliatory and useful effect upon them, and is that which will best secure   their peace and good will. The small vessels authorized by Congress with a view to the Mediterranean service,   have been sent into that sea, and will be able more effectually to confine the   Tripoline cruisers within their harbors, and supersede the necessity of convoy   to our commerce in that quarter. They will sensibly lessen the expenses of that   service the ensuing year. A further knowledge of the ground in the north-eastern and north-western angles   of the United States has evinced that the boundaries established by the treaty   of Paris, between the British territories and ours in those parts, were too   imperfectly described to be susceptible of execution. It has therefore been   thought worthy of attention, for preserving and cherishing the harmony and useful   intercourse subsisting between the two nations, to remove by timely arrangements   what unfavorable incidents might otherwise render a ground of future misunderstanding.   A convention has therefore been entered into, which provides for a practicable   demarkation of those limits to the satisfaction of both parties. An account of the receipts and expenditures of the year ending 30th September   last, with the estimates for the service of the ensuing year, will be laid before   you by the secretary of the treasury so soon as the receipts of the last quarter   shall be returned from the more distant States. It is already ascertained that   the amount paid into the treasury for that year has been between eleven and   twelve millions of dollars, and that the revenue accrued during the same term   exceeds the sum counted on as sufficient for our current expenses, and to extinguish   the public debt within the period heretofore proposed. The amount of debt paid for the same year is about three millions one hundred   thousand dollars, exclusive of interest, and making, with the payment of the   preceding year, a discharge of more than eight millions and a half of dollars   of the principal of that debt, besides the accruing interest; and there remain   in the treasury nearly six millions of dollars. Of these, eight hundred and   eighty thousand have been reserved for payment of the first instalment due under   the British convention of January 8th, 1802, and two millions are what have   been before mentioned as placed by Congress under the power and accountability   of the president, toward the price of New Orleans and other territories acquired,   which, remaining untouched, are still applicable to that object, and go in diminution   of the sum to be funded for it. Should the acquisition of Louisiana be constitutionally confirmed and carried   into effect, a sum of nearly thirteen millions of dollars will then be added   to our public debt, most of which is payable after fifteen years; before which   term the present existing debts will all be discharged by the established operation   of the sinking fund. When we contemplate the ordinary annual augmentation of   imposts from increasing population and wealth, the augmentation of the same   revenue by its extension to the new acquisition, and the economies which may   still be introduced into our public expenditures, I cannot but hope that Congress   in reviewing their resources will find means to meet the intermediate interests   of this additional debt without recurring to new taxes, and applying to this   object only the ordinary progression of our revenue. Its extraordinary increase   in times of foreign war will be the proper and sufficient fund for any measures   of safety or precaution which that state of things may render necessary in our   neutral position. Remittances for the instalments of our foreign debt having been found impracticable   without loss, it has not been thought expedient to use the power given by a   former act of Congress of continuing them by reloans, and of redeeming instead   thereof equal sums of domestic debt, although no difficulty was found in obtaining   that accommodation. The sum of fifty thousand dollars appropriated by Congress for providing gun-boats,   remains unexpended. The favorable and peaceful turn of affairs on the Mississippi   rendered an immediate execution of that law unnecessary, and time was desirable   in order that the institution of that branch of our force might begin on models   the most approved by experience. The same issue of events dispensed with a resort   to the appropriation of a million and a half of dollars contemplated for purposes   which were effected by happier means. We have seen with sincere concern the flames of war lighted up again in Europe,   and nations with which we have the most friendly and useful relations engaged   in mutual destruction. While we regret the miseries in which we see others involved   let us bow with gratitude to that kind Providence which, inspiring with wisdom   and moderation our late legislative councils while placed under the urgency   of the greatest wrongs, guarded us from hastily entering into the sanguinary   contest, and left us only to look on and to pity its ravages. These will be   heaviest on those immediately engaged. Yet the nations pursuing peace will not   be exempt from all evil. In the course of this conflict, let it be our endeavor,   as it is our interest and desire, to cultivate the friendship of the belligerent   nations by every act of justice and of incessant kindness; to receive their   armed vessels with hospitality from the distresses of the sea, but to administer   the means of annoyance to none; to establish in our harbors such a police as   may maintain law and order; to restrain our citizens from embarking individually   in a war in which their country takes no part; to punish severely those persons,   citizen or alien, who shall usurp the cover of our flag for vessels not entitled   to it, infecting thereby with suspicion those of real Americans, and committing   us into controversies for the redress of wrongs not our own; to exact from every   nation the observance, toward our vessels and citizens, of those principles   and practices which all civilized people acknowledge; to merit the character   of a just nation, and maintain that of an independent one, preferring every   consequence to insult and habitual wrong. Congress will consider whether the   existing laws enable us efficaciously to maintain this course with our citizens   in all places, and with others while within the limits of our jurisdiction,   and will give them the new modifications necessary for these objects. Some contraventions   of right have already taken place, both within our jurisdictional limits and   on the high seas. The friendly disposition of the governments from whose agents   they have proceeded, as well as their wisdom and regard for justice, leave us   in reasonable expectation that they will be rectified and prevented in future;   and that no act will be countenanced by them which threatens to disturb our   friendly intercourse. Separated by a wide ocean from the nations of Europe,   and from the political interests which entangle them together, with productions   and wants which render our commerce and friendship useful to them and theirs   to us, it cannot be the interest of any to assail us, nor ours to disturb them.   We should be most unwise, indeed, were we to cast away the singular blessings   of the position in which nature has placed us, the opportunity she has endowed   us with of pursuing, at a distance from foreign contentions, the paths of industry,   peace, and happiness; of cultivating general friendship, and of bringing collisions   of interest to the umpirage of reason rather than of force. How desirable then   must it be, in a government like ours, to see its citizens adopt individually   the views, the interests, and the conduct which their country should pursue,   divesting themselves of those passions and partialities which tend to lessen   useful friendships, and to embarrass and embroil us in the calamitous scenes   of Europe. Confident, fellow citizens, that you will duly estimate the importance   of neutral dispositions toward the observance of neutral conduct, that you will   be sensible how much it is our duty to look on the bloody arena spread before   us with commiseration indeed, but with no other wish than to see it closed,   I am persuaded you will cordially cherish these dispositions in all discussions   among yourselves, and in all communications with your constituents; and I anticipate   with satisfaction the measures of wisdom which the great interests now committed   to _you_ will give you an opportunity of providing, and _myself_ that of approving   and carrying into execution with the fidelity I owe to my country. We have long heard of your nation as a numerous, peaceable, and friendly people; but this is the first visit we have had from its great men at the seat of our government. I welcome you here; am glad to take you by the hand, and to assure you, for your nation, that we are their friends. Born in the same land, we ought to live as brothers, doing to each other all the good we can, and not listening to wicked men, who may endeavor to make us enemies. By living in peace, we can help and prosper one another; by waging war, we can kill and destroy many on both sides; but those who survive will not be the happier for that. Then, brothers, let it forever be peace and good neighborhood between us. Our seventeen States compose a great and growing nation. Their children are as the leaves of the trees, which the winds are spreading over the forest. But we are just also. We take from no nation what belongs to it. Our growing numbers make us always willing to buy lands from our red brethren, when they are willing to sell. But be assured we never mean to disturb them in their possessions. On the contrary, the lines established between us by mutual consent, shall be sacredly preserved, and will protect your lands from all encroachments by our own people or any others. We will give you a copy of the law, made by our great Council, for punishing our people, who may encroach on your lands, or injure you otherwise. Carry it with you to your homes, and preserve it, as the shield which we spread over you, to protect your land, your property and persons.

It is at the request which you sent me in September, signed by Puckshanublee and other chiefs, and which you now repeat, that I listen to your proposition to sell us lands. You say you owe a great debt to your merchants, that you have nothing to pay it with but lands, and you pray us to take lands, and pay your debt. The sum you have occasion for, brothers, is a very great one. We have never yet paid as much to any of our red brethren for the purchase of lands. You propose to us some on the Tombigbee, and some on the Mississippi. Those on the Mississippi suit us well. We wish to have establishments on that river, as resting places for our boats, to furnish them provisions, and to receive our people who fall sick on the way to or from New Orleans, which is now ours. In that quarter, therefore, we are willing to purchase as much as you will spare. But as to the manner in which the line shall be run, we are not judges of it here, nor qualified to make any bargain. But we will appoint persons hereafter to treat with you on the spot, who, knowing the country and quality of the lands, will be better able to agree with you on a line which will give us a just equivalent for the sum of money you want paid.

You have spoken, brothers, of the lands which your fathers formerly sold and marked off to the English, and which they ceded to us with the rest of the country they held here; and you say that, though you do not know whether your fathers were paid for them, you have marked the line over again for us, and do not ask repayment. It has always been the custom, brothers, when lands were bought of the red men, to pay for them immediately, and none of us have ever seen an example of such a debt remaining unpaid. It is to satisfy their immediate wants that the red men have usually sold lands; and in such a case, they would not let the debt be unpaid. The presumption from custom then is strong; so it is also from the great length of time since your fathers sold these lands. But we have, moreover, been informed by persons now living, and who assisted the English in making the purchase, that the price was paid at the time. Were it otherwise, as it was their contract, it would be their debt, not ours.

I rejoice, brothers, to hear you propose to become cultivators of the earth for the maintenance of your families. Be assured you will support them better and with less labor, by raising stock and bread, and by spinning and weaving clothes, than by hunting. A little land cultivated, and a little labor, will procure more provisions than the most successful hunt; and a woman will clothe more by spinning and weaving, than a man by hunting. Compared with you, we are but as of yesterday in this land. Yet see how much more we have multiplied by industry, and the exercise of that reason which you possess in common with us. Follow then our example, brethren, and we will aid you with great pleasure.

The clothes and other necessaries which we sent you the last year, were, as you supposed, a present from us. We never meant to ask land or any other payment for them; and the store which we sent on, was at your request also; and to accommodate you with necessaries at a reasonable price, you wished of course to have it on your land; but the land would continue yours, not ours.

As to the removal of the store, the interpreter, and the agent, and any other matters you may wish to speak about, the Secretary at War will enter into explanations with you, and whatever he says, you may consider as said by myself, and what he promises you will be faithfully performed.

I am glad, brothers, you are willing to go and visit some other parts of our country. Carriages shall be ready to convey you, and you shall be taken care of on your journey; and when you shall have returned here and rested yourselves to your own mind, you shall be sent home by land. We had provided for your coming by land, and were sorry for the mistake which carried you to Savannah instead of Augusta, and exposed you to the risks of a voyage by sea. Had any accident happened to you, though we could not help it, it would have been a cause of great mourning to us. But we thank the Great Spirit who took care of you on the ocean, and brought you safe and in good health to the seat of our great Council; and we hope His care will accompany and protect you, on your journey and return home; and that He will preserve and prosper your nation in all its just pursuits.To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States:  To a people, fellow-citizens, who sincerely desire the happiness and prosperity   of other nations: to those who justly calculate that their own well-being is   advanced by that of the nations with which they have intercourse, it will be   a satisfaction to observe that the war which was lighted up Europe a little   before our last meeting has not yet extended its flames to other nations, nor   been marked by the calamities which sometimes stain the footsteps of war. The   irregularities, too on the ocean, which generally harass the commerce of neutral   nations, have in distant parts, disturbed ours less than on former occasions;   but in the American seas they have been greater from peculiar causes, and even   within our harbors and jurisdiction infringements on the authority of the laws   have been committed which have called for serious attention The friendly conduct   of the Governments from whose officers and subjects these acts have proceeded,   in other respects and in places more under their observation and control, gives   us confidence that our representations on this subject will have been completely   regarded.While noticing the irregularities committed on the ocean by others, those on   our own part should not be omitted nor left unprovided for. Complaints have   been received that persons residing within the United States have taken on themselves   to arm merchant vessels and to force a commerce into certain ports and countries   in defiance of the laws of those countries in defiance of the laws of those   countries. That individuals should undertake to wage private war, independently   of the authority of their country, can not be permitted in a well-ordered society.   Its tendency to produce aggression on the laws and rights of other nations and   to endanger the peace of our own is so oblivious that I doubt not you will adopt   measures for restraining it effectually in future.Soon after the passage of the act of the last session authorizing the establishment   of a district and a port of entry on the waters of the Mobile we learnt that   its object was misunderstood on the part of Spain. Candid explanations were   immediately given and assurances that, reserving our claims in that quarter   as a subject of discussion and arrangement with Spain, no act was mediated in   the meantime inconsistent with peace and friendship existing between the two   nations, and that conformably to these intentions would be the execution of   the law. That Government had, however, thought proper to suspend the ratification   of the convention of 1802; but the explanations which would reach them soon   after, and still more the confirmation of them by the tenor of the instrument   establishing the port and district, may reasonably be expected to replace them   in the dispositions and views of the whole subject which originally dictated   the convention.I have the satisfaction to inform you that the objections which had been urged   by that Government against the validity of our title to the country of Louisana   have been withdrawn, its exact limits, however, remaining still to be settled   between us; and to this is to be added that having prepared and delivered the   stock created in execution of the convention of Paris of April 30, 1803. In   consideration of the cession of that country, we have received from the Government   of France an acknowledgment in due form, of the fulfillment of that stipulation.With the nations of Europe in general our friendship and intercourse are undisturbed,   and from the Governments of the belligerent powers especially we continue to   receive those friendly manifestations which are justly due to an honest neutrality   and to such good offices consistent with that as we have opportunities of rendering.The activity and success of the small force employed in the Mediterranean in   the early part of the present year, the reenforcements sent into that sea, and   the energy of the officers having command in the several vessels will, I trust,   by the sufferings of war, reduce the barbarians of Tripoli to the desire of   peace on proper terms. Great injury, however, ensues to ourselves, as well as   to others interested, from the distance to which prizes must be brought for   adjudication and from the impracticability of bringing hither such as are not   seaworthy.The Bey of Tunis having made requisitions unauthorized by our treaty, their   rejection has produced from him some expressions of discontent. But to those   who expect us to calculate whether a compliance with unjust demands will not   cost us less than a war we must leave as a question of calculation for them   also whether to retire from unjust demands will not cost them less than a war.   We can do to each other very sensible injuries by war, but mutual advantages   of peace make that the best interest of both.Peace and intercourse with other powers on the same coast continue on the footing   on which they are established by treaty.In pursuance of the act providing for the temporary government of Louisana,   the necessary officers for the Territory of Orleans were appointed in due time   to commence the exercise of their functions on the 1st. day of October. The   distance, however, of some of them and indispensable previous arrangements may   have retarded its commencement in some of its parts. The form of government   thus provided having been considered but as temporary, and open to such future   improvements as further information of the circumstances of our brethren there   might suggest, it will of course be subject to your consideration.In the District of Louisana it has been thought best to adopt the division   into subordinate districts which had been established under its former government.   These being five in number, a commanding officer has been appointed to each,   according to the provisions of the law, and so soon as they can be at their   stations that district will also be in its due state of organization. In the   meantime their places are supplied by the officers commanding there. And the   functions of the governor and judges of Indiana having commenced, the government,   we presume is preceding in its new form. The lead mines in that district offer   so rich a supply of that metal as to merit attention. The report now communicated   will inform you of their state and of the necessity of immediate inquiry into   their occupation and titles.With the Indian tribes established within our newly acquired limits, I have   deemed it necessary to open conferences for the purpose of establishing a good   understanding and neighborly relations between us. So far as we have yet learned,   we have reason to believe that their dispositions on their part, we have in   our own hands means which can not fail us for preserving their peace and friendship.   By pursuing an uniform course of justice toward them, by aiding them in all   the improvements which may better their condition, and especially by establishing   a commerce on terms which shall be advantageous to them and only not losing   to us, and so regulated as that no incendiaries of our own or any other nation   may be permitted to disturb the natural effects of our just and friendly offices,   we may render ourselves so necessary to their comfort and prosperity that the   protection of our citizens from their disorderly members will become their interest   and their voluntary care. Instead, therefore, of an augmentation of military   force proportioned to our extension of frontier, I propose a moderate enlargement   of the capital employed in that commerce as a more effectual, economical, and   humane instrument for preserving peace and good neighborhood with them.On this side of the Mississippi an important relinquishment of native title   has been received from the Delawares. That tribe, desiring to extinguish in   their people the spirit of hunting and to convert superfluous lands into the   means of improving what they retain, has ceded to us all the country between   Wabash and Ohio south of and including the road from the rapids toward Vincennes,   for which they are to receive annuities in animals and implements for agriculture   and in other necessaries. This acquisition is important, not only for its extent   and fertility, but as fronting 300 miles on the Ohio, and near half that on   the Wabash. The produce of the settled country descending those rivers will   no longer pass in review of the Indian frontier but in a small portion, and,   with the cession heretofore made by the Kaskaskias, nearly consolidates our   possessions north of the Ohio, in a very respectful breadth-from Lake Erie to   the Mississippi. The Piankeshaws having some claim to the country ceded by the   Delawares, it has been thought best to keep quiet that by fair purchase also.   So soon as the treaties on this subject shall have received their constitutional   sanctions they shall be laid before both Houses.The act of Congress of February 28, 1803, for building and employing a number   of gunboats, is now in a course of execution to the extent there provided for.   The obstacle to naval enterprise which vessels of this construction offer for   our seaport towns, their utility toward supporting within our waters the authority   of the laws, the promptness with which they will be manned by the seamen and   militia of the place in the moment they are wanting, the facility of their assembling   from different parts of the coast to any point where they are required in greater   force than ordinary, the economy of their maintenance and preservation from   decay when not in actual service, and the competence of our finances to this   defensive provision without any new burthen are considerations which will have   due weight with Congress in deciding on the expediency of adding to their number   from year to year, as experience shall test their utility, until all our important   harbors, by these and auxiliary means, shall be secured against insult and opposition   to the laws.No circumstances has arisen since your last session which calls for any augmentation   of our regular military force. Should any improvement occur in militia system,   that will be always seasonable.Accounts of the receipts and expenditures of the last year, with estimates   for the ensuing one, will as usual be laid before you.The state of our finances continues to fulfill our expectations. Eleven millions   and a half of dollars, received in the course of the year ending the 30th of   September last, have enabled us, us, after meeting all the ordinary expenses   of the year, to pay upward of $3,600,000 of the public debt, exclusive of interest.   This payment, with those of the two preceding years, has extinguished upward   of twelve millions of the principle and a greater sum of interest within that   period, and by a proportionate diminution of interest renders already sensible   the effect of the growing sum yearly applicable to the discharge of the principle.It is also ascertained that the revenue accrued during the last year exceeds   that of the preceding, and the probable receipts of the ensuing year may safely   be relied on as sufficient, with the sum already in the Treasury, to meet all   the current demands of the year, to discharge upwards of three millions and   a half of the engagements incurred under the British and French conventions   , and to advance in the further redemption of the funded debt as rapidly as   had been contemplated. These, fellow-citizens, are the principle matters which   I have thought it necessary at this time to communicate for your consideration   and attention. Some others will be laid before you in the course of the session;   but in the discharge of the great duties confided to you by our country you   will take a broader view of the field of legislation. Whether the great interests   of agriculture, manufactures, commerce, or navigation can within the pale of   your constitutional powers be aided in any of their relations; whether laws   are provided in all cases where they are wanting; whether those provided are   exactly what they should be; whether any abuses take place in their administration,   or in that of the public revenues; whether the organization of the public agents   or of the public force is perfect in all its parts; in fine, whether anything   can be done to advance the general good, are questions within the limits of   your functions which will necessarily occupy your attention. In these and all   other matters which you in your wisdom may propose for the good of our country   you may count with assurance on my hearty cooperation and faithful execution.Proceeding, fellow citizens, to that qualification which the constitution   requires, before my entrance on the charge again conferred upon me, it is my   duty to express the deep sense I entertain of this new proof of confidence from   my fellow citizens at large, and the zeal with which it inspires me, so to conduct   myself as may best satisfy their just expectations. On taking this station on a former occasion, I declared the principles on which   I believed it my duty to administer the affairs of our commonwealth. My conscience   tells me that I have, on every occasion, acted up to that declaration, according   to its obvious import, and to the understanding of every candid mind. In the transaction of your foreign affairs, we have endeavored to cultivate   the friendship of all nations, and especially of those with which we have the   most important relations. We have done them justice on all occasions, favored   where favor was lawful, and cherished mutual interests and intercourse on fair   and equal terms. We are firmly convinced, and we act on that conviction, that   with nations, as with individuals, our interests soundly calculated, will ever   be found inseparable from our moral duties; and history bears witness to the   fact, that a just nation is taken on its word, when recourse is had to armaments   and wars to bridle others. At home, fellow citizens, you best know whether we have done well or ill. The   suppression of unnecessary offices, of useless establishments and expenses,   enabled us to discontinue our internal taxes. These covering our land with officers,   and opening our doors to their intrusions, had already begun that process of   domiciliary vexation which, once entered, is scarcely to be restrained from   reaching successively every article of produce and property. If among these   taxes some minor ones fell which had not been inconvenient, it was because their   amount would not have paid the officers who collected them, and because, if   they had any merit, the state authorities might adopt them, instead of others   less approved. The remaining revenue on the consumption of foreign articles, is paid cheerfully   by those who can afford to add foreign luxuries to domestic comforts, being   collected on our seaboards and frontiers only, and incorporated with the transactions   of our mercantile citizens, it may be the pleasure and pride of an American   to ask, what farmer, what mechanic, what laborer, ever sees a tax-gatherer of   the United States? These contributions enable us to support the current expenses   of the government, to fulfil contracts with foreign nations, to extinguish the   native right of soil within our limits, to extend those limits, and to apply   such a surplus to our public debts, as places at a short day their final redemption,   and that redemption once effected, the revenue thereby liberated may, by a just   repartition among the states, and a corresponding amendment of the constitution,   be applied, _in time of peace_, to rivers, canals, roads, arts, manufactures,   education, and other great objects within each state. _In time of war_, if injustice,   by ourselves or others, must sometimes produce war, increased as the same revenue   will be increased by population and consumption, and aided by other resources   reserved for that crisis, it may meet within the year all the expenses of the   year, without encroaching on the rights of future generations, by burdening   them with the debts of the past. War will then be but a suspension of useful   works, and a return to a state of peace, a return to the progress of improvement. I have said, fellow citizens, that the income reserved had enabled us to extend   our limits; but that extension may possibly pay for itself before we are called   on, and in the meantime, may keep down the accruing interest; in all events,   it will repay the advances we have made. I know that the acquisition of Louisiana   has been disapproved by some, from a candid apprehension that the enlargement   of our territory would endanger its union. But who can limit the extent to which   the federative principle may operate effectively? The larger our association,   the less will it be shaken by local passions; and in any view, is it not better   that the opposite bank of the Mississippi should be settled by our own brethren   and children, than by strangers of another family? With which shall we be most   likely to live in harmony and friendly intercourse? In matters of religion, I have considered that its free exercise is placed   by the constitution independent of the powers of the general government. I have   therefore undertaken, on no occasion, to prescribe the religious exercises suited   to it; but have left them, as the constitution found them, under the direction   and discipline of state or church authorities acknowledged by the several religious   societies. The aboriginal inhabitants of these countries I have regarded with the commiseration   their history inspires. Endowed with the faculties and the rights of men, breathing   an ardent love of liberty and independence, and occupying a country which left   them no desire but to be undisturbed, the stream of overflowing population from   other regions directed itself on these shores; without power to divert, or habits   to contend against, they have been overwhelmed by the current, or driven before   it; now reduced within limits too narrow for the hunter's state, humanity enjoins   us to teach them agriculture and the domestic arts; to encourage them to that   industry which alone can enable them to maintain their place in existence, and   to prepare them in time for that state of society, which to bodily comforts   adds the improvement of the mind and morals. We have therefore liberally furnished   them with the implements of husbandry and household use; we have placed among   them instructors in the arts of first necessity; and they are covered with the   aegis of the law against aggressors from among ourselves. But the endeavors to enlighten them on the fate which awaits their present   course of life, to induce them to exercise their reason, follow its dictates,   and change their pursuits with the change of circumstances, have powerful obstacles   to encounter; they are combated by the habits of their bodies, prejudice of   their minds, ignorance, pride, and the influence of interested and crafty individuals   among them, who feel themselves something in the present order of things, and   fear to become nothing in any other. These persons inculcate a sanctimonious   reverence for the customs of their ancestors; that whatsoever they did, must   be done through all time; that reason is a false guide, and to advance under   its counsel, in their physical, moral, or political condition, is perilous innovation;   that their duty is to remain as their Creator made them, ignorance being safety,   and knowledge full of danger; in short, my friends, among them is seen the action   and counteraction of good sense and bigotry; they, too, have their anti-philosophers,   who find an interest in keeping things in their present state, who dread reformation,   and exert all their faculties to maintain the ascendency of habit over the duty   of improving our reason, and obeying its mandates. In giving these outlines, I do not mean, fellow citizens, to arrogate to myself   the merit of the measures; that is due, in the first place, to the reflecting   character of our citizens at large, who, by the weight of public opinion, influence   and strengthen the public measures; it is due to the sound discretion with which   they select from among themselves those to whom they confide the legislative   duties; it is due to the zeal and wisdom of the characters thus selected, who   lay the foundations of public happiness in wholesome laws, the execution of   which alone remains for others; and it is due to the able and faithful auxiliaries,   whose patriotism has associated with me in the executive functions. During this course of administration, and in order to disturb it, the artillery   of the press has been levelled against us, charged with whatsoever its licentiousness   could devise or dare. These abuses of an institution so important to freedom   and science, are deeply to be regretted, inasmuch as they tend to lessen its   usefulness, and to sap its safety; they might, indeed, have been corrected by   the wholesome punishments reserved and provided by the laws of the several States   against falsehood and defamation; but public duties more urgent press on the   time of public servants, and the offenders have therefore been left to find   their punishment in the public indignation. Nor was it uninteresting to the world, that an experiment should be fairly   and fully made, whether freedom of discussion, unaided by power, is not sufficient   for the propagation and protection of truth -- whether a government, conducting   itself in the true spirit of its constitution, with zeal and purity, and doing   no act which it would be unwilling the whole world should witness, can be written   down by falsehood and defamation. The experiment has been tried; you have witnessed   the scene; our fellow citizens have looked on, cool and collected; they saw   the latent source from which these outrages proceeded; they gathered around   their public functionaries, and when the constitution called them to the decision   by suffrage, they pronounced their verdict, honorable to those who had served   them, and consolatory to the friend of man, who believes he may be intrusted   with his own affairs. No inference is here intended, that the laws, provided by the State against   false and defamatory publications, should not be enforced; he who has time,   renders a service to public morals and public tranquillity, in reforming these   abuses by the salutary coercions of the law; but the experiment is noted, to   prove that, since truth and reason have maintained their ground against false   opinions in league with false facts, the press, confined to truth, needs no   other legal restraint; the public judgment will correct false reasonings and   opinions, on a full hearing of all parties; and no other definite line can be   drawn between the inestimable liberty of the press and its demoralizing licentiousness.   If there be still improprieties which this rule would not restrain, its supplement   must be sought in the censorship of public opinion. Contemplating the union of sentiment now manifested so generally, as auguring   harmony and happiness to our future course, I offer to our country sincere congratulations.   With those, too, not yet rallied to the same point, the disposition to do so   is gaining strength; facts are piercing through the veil drawn over them; and   our doubting brethren will at length see, that the mass of their fellow citizens,   with whom they cannot yet resolve to act, as to principles and measures, think   as they think, and desire what they desire; that our wish, as well as theirs,   is, that the public efforts may be directed honestly to the public good, that   peace be cultivated, civil and religious liberty unassailed, law and order preserved;   equality of rights maintained, and that state of property, equal or unequal,   which results to every man from his own industry, or that of his fathers. When   satisfied of these views, it is not in human nature that they should not approve   and support them; in the meantime, let us cherish them with patient affection;   let us do them justice, and more than justice, in all competitions of interest;   and we need not doubt that truth, reason, and their own interests, will at length   prevail, will gather them into the fold of their country, and will complete   their entire union of opinion, which gives to a nation the blessing of harmony,   and the benefit of all its strength. I shall now enter on the duties to which my fellow citizens have again called   me, and shall proceed in the spirit of those principles which they have approved.   I fear not that any motives of interest may lead me astray; I am sensible of   no passion which could seduce me knowingly from the path of justice; but the   weakness of human nature, and the limits of my own understanding, will produce   errors of judgment sometimes injurious to your interests. I shall need, therefore,   all the indulgence I have heretofore experienced -- the want of it will certainly   not lessen with increasing years. I shall need, too, the favor of that Being   in whose hands we are, who led our forefathers, as Israel of old, from their   native land, and planted them in a country flowing with all the necessaries   and comforts of life; who has covered our infancy with his providence, and our   riper years with his wisdom and power; and to whose goodness I ask you to join   with me in supplications, that he will so enlighten the minds of your servants,   guide their councils, and prosper their measures, that whatsoever they do, shall   result in your good, and shall secure to you the peace, friendship, and approbation   of all nations. To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States: The depredations which had been committed on the commerce of the United States during a preceding war by persons under the authority of Spain are sufficiently known to all. These made it a duty to require from that Government indemnifications for our injured citizens. A convention was accordingly entered into between the minister of the United States at Madrid and the minister of that Government for foreign affairs, by which it was agreed that spoliations committed by Spanish subjects and carried into ports of Spain should be paid for by that nation, and that those committed by French subjects and carried into Spanish ports should remain for further discussion. Before this convention was returned to Spain with our ratification the transfer of Louisiana by France to the United States took place, an event as unexpected as disagreeable to Spain. From that moment she seemed to change her conduct and dispositions toward us. It was first manifested by her protest against the right of France to alienate Louisiana to us, which, however, was soon retracted and the right confirmed. Then high offense was manifested at the act of Congress establishing a collection district on the Mobile, although by an authentic declaration immediately made it was expressly confined to our acknowledged limits; and she now refused to ratify the convention signed by her own minister under the eye of his Sovereign unless we would consent to alterations of its terms which would have affected our claims against her for the spoliations by French subjects carried into Spanish ports.To obtain justice as well as to restore friendship I thought a special mission advisable, and accordingly appointed James Monroe minister extraordinary and plenipotentiary to repair to Madrid, and in conjunction with our minister resident there to endeavor to procure a ratification of the former convention and to come to an understanding with Spain as to the boundaries of Louisiana. It appeared at once that her policy was to reserve herself for events, and in the meantime to keep our differences in an undetermined state. This will be evident from the papers now communicated to you. After nearly five months of fruitless endeavor to bring them to some definite and satisfactory result, our ministers ended the conferences without having been able to obtain indemnity for spoliations of any description or any satisfaction as to the boundaries of Louisiana, other than a declaration that we had no rights eastward of the Iberville, and that our line to the west was one which would have left us but a string of land on that bank of the river Mississippi. Our injured citizens were thus left without any prospect of retribution from the wrongdoer, and as to boundary each party was to take its own course. That which they have chosen to pursue will appear from the documents now communicated. They authorize the inference that it is their intention to advance on our possessions until they shall be repressed by an opposing force. Considering that Congress alone is constitutionally invested with the power of changing our condition from peace to war, I have thought it my duty to await their authority for using force in any degree which could be avoided. I have barely instructed the officers stationed in the neighborhood of the aggressions to protect our citizens from violence, to patrol within the borders actually delivered to us, and not to go out of them but when necessary to repel an inroad or to rescue a citizen or his property; and the Spanish officers remaining at New Orleans are required to depart without further delay. It ought to be noted here that since the late change in the state of affairs in Europe Spain has ordered her cruisers and courts to respect our treaty with her.The conduct of France and the part she may take in the misunderstandings between the United States and Spain are too important to be unconsidered. She was prompt and decided in her declarations that our demands on Spain for French spoliations carried into Spanish ports were included in the settlement between the United States and France. She took at once the ground that she had acquired no right from Spain, and had meant to deliver us none eastward of the Iberville, her silence as to the western boundary leaving us to infer her opinion might be against Spain in that quarter. Whatever direction she might mean to give to these differences, it does not appear that she has contemplated their proceeding to actual rupture, or that at the date of our last advices from Paris her Government had any suspicion of the hostile attitude Spain had taken here; on the contrary, we have reason to believe that she was disposed to effect a settlement on a plan analogous to what our ministers had proposed, and so comprehensive as to remove as far as possible the grounds of future collision and controversy on the eastern as well as western side of the Mississippi.The present crisis in Europe is favorable for pressing such a settlement, and not a moment should be lost in availing ourselves of it. Should it pass unimproved, our situation would become much more difficult. Formal war is not necessary--it is not probable it will follow; but the protection of our citizens, the spirit and honor of our country require that force should be interposed to a certain degree It will probably contribute to advance the object of peace.But the course to be pursued will require the command of means which it belongs to Congress exclusively to yield or to deny. To them I communicate every fact material for their information and the documents necessary to enable them to judge for themselves. To their wisdom, then, I look for the course I am to pursue, and will pursue with sincere zeal that which they shall approve.TH: JEFFERSON.To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States:  At a moment when the nations of Europe are in commotion and arming against each   other, and when those with whom we have principle intercourse are engaged in   the general contest, and when the countenance of some of them toward our peaceable   country threatens that even that may not be affected by what is passing on the   general theater, a meeting of the representatives of the nation in both Houses   of Congress has become more than usually desirable. Coming from every section   of our country, they bring with them the sentiments and the information of the   whole, And will be enabled to give direction to the public affairs which the   will and the wisdom of the whole will approve and support.In taking a view of the state of our country we in the first place notice the   late affliction of two of our cities under the fatal fever which in latter times   has occasionally visited our shores. Providence in His goodness gave it an early   termination on this occasion and lessened the number of victims which have usually   fallen before it. In the course of the several visitations by this disease it   has appeared that it is strictly local, incident to cities and on the tide waters   only, incommunicable in the country either by persons under the disease or by   goods carried from diseased places; that its access is with the autumn and it   disappears with the early frosts. These restrictions within narrow limits of   time and space give security even to our maritime cities three fourths of the   year, and to the country always. Although from these facts it appears unnecessary,   yet to satisfy the fears of foreign nations and cautions on their part not to   be complained of in a danger whose limits are yet unknown to them I have strictly   enjoined on the officers at the head of customs to certify with exact truth,   for every vessel sailing for a foreign port the state of health respecting this   fever which prevails at the place from which she sails.. Under every motive   from character and duty to certify the truth, I have no doubt they have faithfully   executed this injunction. Much real injury has, however, been sustained from   a propensity to identify with this endemic and to call by the same name fevers   of very different kinds, which have been placed among those deemed contagious.   As we advance in our knowledge of this disease, as facts develop the source   from which individuals receive it, the State authorities charged with the care   of the public health, and Congress with that of the general commerce, will become   able to regulate with effect their respective functions in these departments.   The burthen of quarantines is felt at home as well as abroad; their efficacy   merits examination. Although the health laws of the States should be found to   need no present revisal by Congress, yet commerce claims that their attention   be ever awake to them.Since our last meeting the aspect of our foreign relations has considerably   changed. Our coasts have been infested and our harbors watched by private armed   vessels, some of them without commissions, some with illegal commissions, others   with those legal form. But committing piratical acts beyond the authority of   their commissions. They have captured in the very entrance of our harbors ,   as well as on the high seas, not only the vessels of our friends coming to trade   with us, but our own also. They have carried them off under pretense of legal   adjudication but not daring to approach a court of justice, they have plundered   and sunk them by the way or in obscure places where no evidence could arise   against them, maltreated the crews, and abandoned them in boats in the open   sea or on desert shores without food or covering. These enormities appearing   to be unreached by any control of their sovereigns, I found it necessary to   equip a force to cruise within our own seas, to arrest all vessels of these   descriptions found hovering on our coasts within the limits of the Gulf Stream   and to bring the offenders in for trial as pirates.The same system of hovering on our coasts and harbors under color of seeking   enemies has been also carried on by public armed ships to the great annoyance   and oppression of our commerce. New principles, too, have been interpolated   into the law of nations, founded neither in justice nor the usage or acknowledgment   of nations. According to these belligerent takes to itself a commerce with its   own enemy which it denies to a neutral on the ground of its aiding that enemy   in the war; but reason revolts at such an inconsistency, and the neutral having   equal right with the belligerent to decide the question, the interests of our   constituents and the duty of maintaining the authority of reason, the only umpire   between just nations, impose on us the obligation of providing an effectual   and determined opposition to a doctrine so injurious to the rights of peaceable   nations. Indeed, the confidence we ought to have in the justice of others still   countenances the hope that a sounder view of those rights will of itself induce   from every belligerent a more correct observance of them.With Spain our negotiations for a settlement of differences have not had a   satisfactory issue. Spoliations during a former war, for which she had formally   acknowledged herself responsible, have been refused to be compensated but on   conditions affecting other claims in no wise connected with them. Yet the same   practices are renewed in the present war and are already of great amount. On   the Mobile, our commerce passing through that river continues to be obstructed   by arbitrary duties and vexatious searches. Propositions for adjusting amicably   the boundaries of Louisana have not been acceded to. While, however, the right   is unsettled, we have avoided changing the state of things by taking new posts   or strengthening ourselves in the disputed territories, in the hope that the   other power would not by contrary conduct oblige us to meet their example and   endanger conflicts of authority the issue of which may not be easily controlled.   But in this hope we have now reason to lessen our confidence. Inroads have been   recently made into the Territories of Orleans and the Mississippi, our citizens   have been seized and their property plundered in the very parts of the former   which had been actually delivered up by Spain, and this by the regular officers   and soldiers of that Government. I have therefore found it necessary at length   to give orders to our troops on that frontier to be in readiness to protect   our citizens, and to repel by arms any similar aggressions in future. Other   details necessary for your full information of the state of things between this   country and that shall be the subject of another communication.In reviewing these injuries from some of the belligerent powers the moderation,   the firmness, and the wisdom of the Legislature will all be called into action.   We ought still to hope that time and a more correct estimate of interest as   well as of character will produce the justice we are bound to expect. But should   any nation deceive itself by false calculations and disappointment that expectation,   we must join in unprofitable contest of trying which party can do the other   the most harm. Some of these injuries may perhaps admit a peaceable remedy.   Where that is competent it is always the most desirable. But some of them are   of a nature to be met by force only, and all of them may lead to it. I can not,   therefore, but recommend such preparations as circumstances call for. The first   object is to place our seaport town out of danger of insult. Measures have been   already taken for furnishing them with heavy cannon for the service of such   land batteries as may make apart of their defense against armed vessels approaching   them. In aid of these it is desirable we should have a competent number of gunboats,   and the number, to be competent, must be considerable. If immediately begun,   they may be in readiness for service at the opening of the next season. Whether   it will be necessary to augment our land forces will be decided buy occurrences   probably in the course of your session. In the meantime you will consider whether   it would not be expedient for a state of peace as well as war so to organize   or class the militia as would enable us on any sudden emergency to call for   the services of the younger portions unencumbered with the old and those having   families. Upward of 300,000 able-bodied men between the ages of 18 and 26 years,   which the last census shews we may now count within our limits, will furnish   a competent number for offense or defense in any point where they may be wanted,   and will give time for raising regular forces after the necessity of them shall   become certain; and the reducing to the early period of life all its active   service can not but be desirable to our younger citizens of the present as well   as future times, inasmuch as it engages to them in more advanced age a quiet   and undisturbed repose in the bosom of their families. I can not, then, but   earnestly recommend to your early consideration the expediency of so modifying   our militia system as, by a separation of the more active part from that which   is less so, we may draw from it when necessary an efficient corps fit for real   and active service, and to be called to it in regular rotation.Considerable provision has been made under former authorities from Congress   of materials for the construction of ships of war of 74 guns. These materials   are on hand subject to the further will of the Legislature.Turning from these unpleasant views of violence and wrong, I congratulate you   on the liberation of our fellow-citizens who were stranded on the coast of Tripoli   and made prisoners of war. In a government bottomed on the will of all the life   and liberty of every individual citizen become interesting to all. In the treaty,   therefore, which has concluded our warefare with that State an article for the   ransom of our citizens has been agreed to. An operation by land by a small band   of our countrymen and others, engaged for the occasion in conjunction with the   troops of the ex-Bashaw of that county, gallantly conducted by our late consul,   Eaton, and their successful enterprise on the city of Derne, contributed doubtless   to the impression which produced peace, and the concluison of this prevented   opportunities of which the officers and men of our squadron destined for Tripoli   would have availed themselves to emulate the acts of valor exhibited by their   brethren in the attack of last year. Reflecting with high satisfaction on the   distinguished bravery displayed whenever occasions permitted in the late Mediterranean   service, I think it would be an useful encouragement as well as a just reward   to make an opening for some present promotion by enlarging our peace establishment   of captains and lieutenants.With Tunis some misunderstandings have arisen not yet sufficiently explained,   but friendly discussions with their ambassador recently arrived and a mutual   disposition to do whatever is just and reasonable can not fail of dissipating   these, so that we may consider our peace on that coast, generally, to be on   as sound a footing as it has been at any preceding time. Still, it will not   be expedient to withdraw immediately the whole of our force from that sea.The law providing for a naval peace establishment fixes the number of frigates   which shall be kept in constant service in time of peace, and prescribes that   they shall be manned by not more than two-thirds of their complement of seamen   and ordinary seamen. Whether a frigate may be trusted to two-thirds only of   her proper complement of men must depend on the nature of the service on which   she is ordered; that may sometimes, for her safety as well as to insure her   object, require her fullest complement. In adverting to this subject Congress   will perhaps consider whether the best limitation on the Executive discretion   in this case would not be by the number of seamen which may be employed in the   whole service rather than by the number of the vessels. Occasions oftener arise   for the employment of small than of large vessels, and it would lessen risk   as well as expense to be authorized to employ them of preference. The limitation   suggested by the number of seamen would admit a selection of vessels best adapted   to the service.Our Indian neighbors are advancing, many of them with spirit, and others beginning   to engage in the pursuits of agriculture and household manufacture. They are   becoming sensible that the earth yields subsistence with less labor and more   certainty than the forest, and find it their interest from time e to time to   dispose of parts of their surplus and waste lands for the means of improving   those they occupy and of subsisting their families while they are preparing   their farms. Since your last session the Northern tribes have sold to us the   lands between the Connecticut Reserve and the former Indian boundary and those   on the Ohio rom the same boundary to the rapids and for a considerable depth   inland. The Chickasaws and Cherokees have sold us the country between and adjacent   to the two districts of Tennessee, and the Creeks the residue of their lands   in the fork of Ocmulgee up to the Olcofauhatche. The three former purchases   are important, inasmuch as they consolidate disjoined parts of our settled country   and render their intercourse secure; and the second particularly so, as , with   the small point on the river which we expect is by this time ceded by the Piankeshaws,   it completes our possession of the whole of both banks of the Ohio from its   source to near its mouth, and the navigation of that river is thereby rendered   forever safe to our citizens settled and settling on its extensive waters. The   purchase from the Creeks, too, has been for some time particularly interesting   to the State of Georgia.The several treaties which have been mentioned will be submitted to both houses   of Congress for the exercise of their respective functions.Deputations now on their way to the seat of Government from various nations   of Indians inhabiting the Missouri and other parts beyond the Mississippi come   charged with assurances of their satisfaction with the new relations in which   they are placed with us, of their dispositions to cultivate our peace and friendship,   and their desire to enter into commercial intercourse with us. A state of our   progress in exploring the principle rivers of that country, and of the information   respecting them hitherto obtained, will be communicated so soon as we shall   receive some further relations which we have reason shortly to expect.The receipts at the Treasury during the year ending on the 30th day of September   last have exceeded the sum 13,000,000, which , with not quite five millions   in the Treasury at the beginning of the year have enabled us after meeting other   demands to pay nearly two millions of the debt contracted under the British   treaty and convention upward of four millions of principle of the public debt   and four millions of interest. These payments, with those which had been made   in three years and a half preceding, have extinguished of the funded debt nearly   eighteen millions of principle. Congress by their act of November 10, 1803,   authorized us to borrow $1,750,000 toward meeting the claims of our citizens   assumed by the convention with France. We have not, however, made use o this   authority, because the sum of four millions and a half which remained in the   Treasury on the same 30th day of September last, with receipts which we may   calculate on for the ensuing year, besides paying the annual sum of $8,000,000   appropriated to the funded debt and meeting all the current demands which may   be expected, will enable us to pay the whole sum of $3,750,000 assumed by the   French convention and still leave us a surplus of nearly $1,000,000 at our free   disposal. Should you concur in the provisions of arms and armed vessels recommended   by the circumstances of the times, this surplus will furnish the means of doing   so.On this first occasion of addressing Congress since, by the choice of my constituents,   I have entered on a second term of administration, I embrace the opportunity   to give this public assurance that I will exert my best endeavors to administer   faithfully the executive department, and will zealously cooperate with you in   every measure which may tend to secure the liberty, property, and personal safety   of our fellow-citizens, and to consolidate the republican forms and principles   of our Government.In the course of your session you shall receive all the aid which I can give   for the dispatch of public business, and all the information necessary for your   deliberations, of which the interests of our own country and the confidence   reposed in us by others will admit a communication.MY FRIENDS AND CHILDREN, CHIEFLY OF THE CHEROKEE NATION,          Having now finished our business an to mutual satisfaction, I cannot take leave   of you without expressing the satisfaction I have received from your visit.   I see with my own eyes that the endeavors we have been making to encourage and   lead you in the way of improving your situation have not been unsuccessful;   it has been like grain sown in good ground, producing abundantly. You are becoming   farmers, learning the use of the plough and the hoe, enclosing your grounds   and employing that labor in their cultivation which you formerly employed in   hunting and in war; and I see handsome specimens of cotton cloth raised, spun   and wove by yourselves. You are also raising cattle and hogs for your food,   and horses to assist your labors. Go on, my children, in the same way and be   assured the further you advance in it the happier and more respectable you will   be. Our brethren, whom you have happened to meet here from the West and Northwest,   have enabled you to compare your situation now with what it was formerly. They   also make the comparison, and they see how far you are ahead of them, and seeing   what you are they are encouraged to do as you have done. You will find your   next want to be mills to grind your corn, which by relieving your women from   the loss of time in beating it into meal, will enable them to spin and weave   more. When a man has enclosed and improved his farm, builds a good house on   it and raised plentiful stocks of animals, he will wish when he dies that these   things shall go to his wife and children, whom he loves more than he does his   other relations, and for whom he will work with pleasure during his life. You   will, therefore, find it necessary to establish laws for this. When a man has   property, earned by his own labor, he will not like to see another come and   take it from him because he happens to be stronger, or else to defend it by   spilling blood. You will find it necessary then to appoint good men, as judges,   to decide contests between man and man, according to reason and to the rules   you shall establish. If you wish to be aided by our counsel and experience in   these things we shall always be ready to assist you with our advice. My children, it is unnecessary for me to advise you against spending all your   time and labor in warring with and destroying your fellow-men, and wasting your   own members. You already see the folly and iniquity of it. Your young men, however,   are not yet sufficiently sensible of it. Some of them cross the Mississippi   to go and destroy people who have never done them an injury. My children, this   is wrong and must not be; if we permit them to cross the Mississippi to war   with the Indians on the other side of that river, we must let those Indians   cross the river to take revenge on you. I say again, this must not be. The Mississippi   now belongs to us. It must not be a river of blood. It is now the water-path   along which all our people of Natchez, St. Louis, Indiana, Ohio, Tennessee,   Kentucky and the western parts of Pennsylvania and Virginia are constantly passing   with their property, to and from New Orleans. Young men going to war are not   easily restrained. Finding our people on the river they will rob them, perhaps   kill them. This would bring on a war between us and you. It is better to stop   this in time by forbidding your young men to go across the river to make war.   If they go to visit or to live with the Cherokees on the other side of the river   we shall not object to that. That country is ours. We will permit them to live   in it. My children, this is what I wished to say to you. To go on in learning to cultivate   the earth and to avoid war. If any of your neighbors injure you, our beloved   men whom we place with you will endeavor to obtain justice for you and we will   support them in it. If any of your bad people injure your neighbors, be ready   to acknowledge it and to do them justice. It is more honorable to repair a wrong   than to persist in it. Tell all your chiefs, your men, women and children, that   I take them by the hand and hold it fast. That I am their father, wish their   happiness and well-being, and am always ready to promote their good. My children, I thank you for your visit and pray to the Great Spirit who made   us all and planted us all in this land to live together like brothers that He   will conduct you safely to your homes, and grant you to find your families and   your friends in good health. TO THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE UNITED STATES   IN CONGRESS ASSEMBLED:          It would have given me, fellow citizens, great satisfaction to announce in the   moment of your meeting that the difficulties in our foreign relations, existing   at the time of your last separation, had been amicably and justly terminated.   I lost no time in taking those measures which were most likely to bring them   to such a termination, by special missions charged with such powers and instructions   as in the event of failure could leave no imputation on either our moderation   or forbearance. The delays which have since taken place in our negotiations   with the British government appears to have proceeded from causes which do not   forbid the expectation that during the course of the session I may be enabled   to lay before you their final issue. What will be that of the negotiations for   settling our differences with Spain, nothing which had taken place at the date   of the last despatches enables us to pronounce. On the western side of the Mississippi   she advanced in considerable force, and took post at the settlement of Bayou   Pierre, on the Red river. This village was originally settled by France, was   held by her as long as she held Louisiana, and was delivered to Spain only as   a part of Louisiana. Being small, insulated, and distant, it was not observed,   at the moment of redelivery to France and the United States, that she continued   a guard of half a dozen men which had been stationed there. A proposition, however,   having been lately made by our commander-in-chief, to assume the Sabine river   as a temporary line of separation between the troops of the two nations until   the issue of our negotiations shall be known; this has been referred by the   Spanish commandant to his superior, and in the meantime, he has withdrawn his   force to the western side of the Sabine river. The correspondence on this subject,   now communicated, will exhibit more particularly the present state of things   in that quarter.The nature of that country requires indispensably that an unusual proportion   of the force employed there should be cavalry or mounted infantry. In order,   therefore, that the commanding officer might be enabled to act with effect,   I had authorized him to call on the governors of Orleans and Mississippi for   a corps of five hundred volunteer cavalry. The temporary arrangement he has   proposed may perhaps render this unnecessary. But I inform you with great pleasure   of the promptitude with which the inhabitants of those territories have tendered   their services in defence of their country. It has done honor to themselves,   entitled them to the confidence of their fellow-citizens in every part of the   Union, and must strengthen the general determination to protect them efficaciously   under all circumstances which may occur.Having received information that in another part of the United States a great   number of private individuals were combining together, arming and organizing   themselves contrary to law, to carry on military expeditions against the territories   of Spain, I thought it necessary, by proclamations as well as by special orders,   to take measures for preventing and suppressing this enterprise, for seizing   the vessels, arms, and other means provided for it, and for arresting and bringing   to justice its authors and abettors. It was due to that good faith which ought   ever to be the rule of action in public as well as in private transactions;   it was due to good order and regular government, that while the public force   was acting strictly on the defensive and merely to protect our citizens from   aggression, the criminal attempts of private individuals to decide for their   country the question of peace or war, by commencing active and unauthorized   hostilities, should be promptly and efficaciously suppressed.Whether it will be necessary to enlarge our regular force will depend on the   result of our negotiation with Spain; but as it is uncertain when that result   will be known, the provisional measures requisite for that, and to meet any   pressure intervening in that quarter, will be a subject for your early consideration.The possession of both banks of the Mississippi reducing to a single point   the defence of that river, its waters, and the country adjacent, it becomes   highly necessary to provide for that point a more adequate security. Some position   above its mouth, commanding the passage of the river, should be rendered sufficiently   strong to cover the armed vessels which may be stationed there for defence,   and in conjunction with them to present an insuperable obstacle to any force   attempting to pass. The approaches to the city of New Orleans, from the eastern   quarter also, will require to be examined, and more effectually guarded. For   the internal support of the country, the encouragement of a strong settlement   on the western side of the Mississippi, within reach of New Orleans, will be   worthy the consideration of the legislature.The gun-boats authorized by an act of the last session are so advanced that   they will be ready for service in the ensuing spring. Circumstances permitted   us to allow the time necessary for their more solid construction. As a much   larger number will still be wanting to place our seaport towns and waters in   that state of defence to which we are competent and they entitled, a similar   appropriation for a further provision for them is recommended for the ensuing   year.A further appropriation will also be necessary for repairing fortifications   already established, and the erection of such works as may have real effect   in obstructing the approach of an enemy to our seaport towns, or their remaining   before them.In a country whose constitution is derived from the will of the people, directly   expressed by their free suffrages; where the principal executive functionaries,   and those of the legislature, are renewed by them at short periods; where under   the characters of jurors, they exercise in person the greatest portion of the   judiciary powers; where the laws are consequently so formed and administered   as to bear with equal weight and favor on all, restraining no man in the pursuits   of honest industry, and securing to every one the property which that acquires,   it would not be supposed that any safeguards could be needed against insurrection   or enterprise on the public peace or authority. The laws, however, aware that   these should not be trusted to moral restraints only, have wisely provided punishments   for these crimes when committed. But would it not be salutary to give also the   means of preventing their commission? Where an enterprise is meditated by private   individuals against a foreign nation in amity with the United States, powers   of prevention to a certain extent are given by the laws; would they not be as   reasonable and useful were the enterprise preparing against the United States?   While adverting to this branch of the law, it is proper to observe, that in   enterprises meditated against foreign nations, the ordinary process of binding   to the observance of the peace and good behavior, could it be extended to acts   to be done out of the jurisdiction of the United States, would be effectual   in some cases where the offender is able to keep out of sight every indication   of his purpose which could draw on him the exercise of the powers now given   by law.The states on the coast of Barbary seem generally disposed at present to respect   our peace and friendship; with Tunis alone some uncertainty remains. Persuaded   that it is our interest to maintain our peace with them on equal terms, or not   at all, I propose to send in due time a reinforcement into the Mediterranean,   unless previous information shall show it to be unnecessary.We continue to receive proofs of the growing attachment of our Indian neighbors,   and of their disposition to place all their interests under the patronage of   the United States. These dispositions are inspired by their confidence in our   justice, and in the sincere concern we feel for their welfare; and as long as   we discharge these high and honorable functions with the integrity and good   faith which alone can entitle us to their continuance, we may expect to reap   the just reward in their peace and friendship.The expedition of Messrs. Lewis and Clarke, for exploring the river Missouri,   and the best communication from that to the Pacific ocean, has had all the success   which could have been expected. They have traced the Missouri nearly to its   source, descended the Columbia to the Pacific ocean, ascertained with accuracy   the geography of that interesting communication across our continent, learned   the character of the country, of its commerce, and inhabitants; and it is but   justice to say that Messrs. Lewis and Clarke, and their brave companions, have   by this arduous service deserved well of their country.The attempt to explore the Red river, under the direction of Mr. Freeman, though   conducted with a zeal and prudence meriting entire approbation, has not been   equally successful. After proceeding up it about six hundred miles, nearly as   far as the French settlements had extended while the country was in their possession,   our geographers were obliged to return without completing their work.Very useful additions have also been made to our knowledge of the Mississippi   by Lieutenant Pike, who has ascended to its source, and whose journal and map,   giving the details of the journey, will shortly be ready for communication to   both houses of Congress. Those of Messrs. Lewis and Clarke, and Freeman, will   require further time to be digested and prepared. These important surveys, in   addition to those before possessed, furnish materials for commencing an accurate   map of the Mississippi, and its western waters. Some principal rivers, however,   remain still to be explored, toward which the authorization of Congress, by   moderate appropriations, will be requisite.I congratulate you, fellow-citizens, on the approach of the period at which   you may interpose your authority constitutionally, to withdraw the citizens   of the United States from all further participation in those violations of human   rights which have been so long continued on the unoffending inhabitants of Africa,   and which the morality, the reputation, and the best interests of our country,   have long been eager to proscribe. Although no law you may pass can take prohibitory   effect till the first day of the year one thousand eight hundred and eight,   yet the intervening period is not too long to prevent, by timely notice, expeditions   which cannot be completed before that day.The receipts at the treasury during the year ending on the 30th of September   last, have amounted to near fifteen millions of dollars, which have enabled   us, after meeting the current demands, to pay two millions seven hundred thousand   dollars of the American claims, in part of the price of Louisiana; to pay of   the funded debt upward of three millions of principal, and nearly four of interest;   and in addition, to reimburse, in the course of the present month, near two   millions of five and a half per cent. stock. These payments and reimbursements   of the funded debt, with those which have been made in the four years and a   half preceding, will, at the close of the present year, have extinguished upwards   of twenty-three millions of principal.The duties composing the Mediterranean fund will cease by law at the end of   the present season. Considering, however, that they are levied chiefly on luxuries,   and that we have an impost on salt, a necessary of life, the free use of which   other-wise is so important, I recommend to your consideration the suppression   of the duties on salt, and the continuation of the Mediterranean fund, instead   thereof, for a short time, after which that also will become unnecessary for   any purpose now within contemplation.When both of these branches of revenue shall in this way be relinquished, there   will still ere long be an accumulation of moneys in the treasury beyond the   instalments of public debt which we are permitted by contract to pay. They cannot,   then, without a modification assented to by the public creditors, be applied   to the extinguishment of this debt, and the complete liberation of our revenues   -- the most desirable of all objects; nor, if our peace continues, will they   be wanting for any other existing purpose. The question, therefore, now comes   forward, -- to what other objects shall these surpluses be appropriated, and   the whole surplus of impost, after the entire discharge of the public debt,   and during those intervals when the purposes of war shall not call for them?   Shall we suppress the impost and give that advantage to foreign over domestic   manufactures? On a few articles of more general and necessary use, the suppression   in due season will doubtless be right, but the great mass of the articles on   which impost is paid is foreign luxuries, purchased by those only who are rich   enough to afford themselves the use of them. Their patriotism would certainly   prefer its continuance and application to the great purposes of the public education,   roads, rivers, canals, and such other objects of public improvement as it may   be thought proper to add to the constitutional enumeration of federal powers.   By these operations new channels of communication will be opened between the   States; the lines of separation will disappear, their interests will be identified,   and their union cemented by new and indissoluble ties. Education is here placed   among the articles of public care, not that it would be proposed to take its   ordinary branches out of the hands of private enterprise, which manages so much   better all the concerns to which it is equal; but a public institution can alone   supply those sciences which, though rarely called for, are yet necessary to   complete the circle, all the parts of which contribute to the improvement of   the country, and some of them to its preservation. The subject is now proposed   for the consideration of Congress, because, if approved by the time the State   legislatures shall have deliberated on this extension of the federal trusts,   and the laws shall be passed, and other arrangements made for their execution,   the necessary funds will be on hand and without employment. I suppose an amendment   to the constitution, by consent of the States, necessary, because the objects   now recommended are not among those enumerated in the constitution, and to which   it permits the public moneys to be applied.The present consideration of a national establishment for education, particularly,   is rendered proper by this circumstance also, that if Congress, approving the   proposition, shall yet think it more eligible to found it on a donation of lands,   they have it now in their power to endow it with those which will be among the   earliest to produce the necessary income. This foundation would have the advantage   of being independent on war, which may suspend other improvements by requiring   for its own purposes the resources destined for them.This, fellow citizens, is the state of the public interest at the present moment,   and according to the information now possessed. But such is the situation of   the nations of Europe, and such too the predicament in which we stand with some   of them, that we cannot rely with certainty on the present aspect of our affairs   that may change from moment to moment, during the course of your session or   after you shall have separated. Our duty is, therefore, to act upon things as   they are, and to make a reasonable provision for whatever they may be. Were   armies to be raised whenever a speck of war is visible in our horizon, we never   should have been without them. Our resources would have been exhausted on dangers   which have never happened, instead of being reserved for what is really to take   place. A steady, perhaps a quickened pace in preparations for the defence of   our seaport towns and waters; an early settlement of the most exposed and vulnerable   parts of our country; a militia so organized that its effective portions can   be called to any point in the Union, or volunteers instead of them to serve   a sufficient time, are means which may always be ready yet never preying on   our resources until actually called into use. They will maintain the public   interests while a more permanent force shall be in course of preparation. But   much will depend on the promptitude with which these means can be brought into   activity. If war be forced upon us in spite of our long and vain appeals to   the justice of nations, rapid and vigorous movements in its outset will go far   toward securing us in its course and issue, and toward throwing its burdens   on those who render necessary the resort from reason to force.The result of our negotiations, or such incidents in their course as may enable   us to infer their probable issue; such further movements also on our western   frontiers as may show whether war is to be pressed there while negotiation is   protracted elsewhere, shall be communicated to you from time to time as they   become known to me, with whatever other information I possess or may receive,   which may aid your deliberations on the great national interests committed to   your charge. MY CHILDREN, THE WOLF AND PEOPLE OF THE MANDAN NATION:  I take you by the hand of friendship hearty welcome to the seat of the government   of the United States. The journey which you have taken to visit your fathers   on this side of our island is a long one, and your having undertaken it is a   proof that you desired to become acquainted with us. I thank the Great Spirit   that he has protected you through the journey and brought you safely to the   residence of your friends, and I hope He will have you constantly in his safe   keeping, and restore you in good health to your nations and families. My friends and children, we are descended from the old nations which live beyond   the great water, but we and our forefathers have been so long here that we seem   like you to have grown out of this land. We consider ourselves no longer of   the old nations beyond the great water, but as united in one family with our   red brethren here. The French, the English, the Spaniards, have now agreed with   us to retire from all the country which you and we hold between Canada and Mexico,   and never more to return to it. And remember the words I now speak to you, my   children, they are never to return again. We are now your fathers; and you shall   not lose by the change. As soon as Spain had agreed to withdraw from all the   waters of the Missouri and Mississippi, I felt the desire of becoming acquainted   with all my red children beyond the Mississippi, and of uniting them with us   as we have those on this side of that river, in the bonds of peace and friendship.   I wished to learn what we could do to benefit them by furnishing them the necessaries   they want in exchange for their furs and peltries. I therefore sent our beloved   man, Captain Lewis, one of my own family, to go up the Missouri river to get   acquainted with all the Indian nations in its neighborhood, to take them by   the hand, deliver my talks to them, and to inform us in what way we could be   useful to them. Your nation received him kindly, you have taken him by the hand   and been friendly to him. My children, I thank you for the services you rendered   him, and for your attention to his words. He will now tell us where we should   establish trading houses to be convenient to you all, and what we must send   to them. My friends and children, I have now an important advice to give you. I have   already told you that you and all the red men are my children, and I wish you   to live in peace and friendship with one another as brethren of the same family   ought to do. How much better is it for neighbors to help than to hurt one another;   how much happier must it make them. If you will cease to make war on one another,   if you will live in friendship with all mankind, you can employ all your time   in providing food and clothing for yourselves and your families. Your men will   not be destroyed in war, and your women and children will lie down to sleep   in their cabins without fear of being surprised by their enemies and killed   or carried away. Your numbers will be increased instead of diminishing, and   you will live in plenty and in quiet. My children, I have given this advice   to all your red brethren on this side of the Mississippi; they are following   it, they are increasing in their numbers, are learning to clothe and provide   for their families as we do. Remember then my advice, my children, carry it   home to your people, and tell them that from the day that they have become all   of the same family, from the day that we became father to them all, we wish,   as a true father should do, that we may all live together as one household,   and that before they strike one another, they should go to their father and   let him endeavor to make up the quarrel. My children, you are come from the other side of our great island, from where   the sun sets, to see your new friends at the sun rising. You have now arrived   where the waters are constantly rising and falling every day, but you are still   distant from the sea. I very much desire that you should not stop here, but   go and see your brethren as far as the edge of the great water. I am persuaded   you have so far seen that every man by the way has received you as his brothers,   and has been ready to do you all the kindness in his power. You will see the   same thing quite to the sea shore; and I wish you, therefore, to go and visit   our great cities in that quarter, and see how many friends and brothers you   have here. You will then have travelled a long line from west to east, and if   you had time to go from north to south, from Canada to Florida, you would find   it as long in that direction, and all the people as sincerely your friends.   I wish you, my children, to see all you can, and to tell your people all you   see; because I am sure the more they know of us, the more they will be our hearty   friends. I invite you, therefore, to pay a visit to Baltimore, Philadelphia,   New York, and the cities still beyond that, if you are willing to go further.   We will provide carriages to convey you and a person to go with you to see that   you want for nothing. By the time you come back the snows will be melted on   the mountains, the ice in the rivers broken up, and you will be wishing to set   out on your return home. My children, I have long desired to see you; I have now opened my heart to   you, let my words sink into your hearts and never be forgotten. If ever lying   people or bad spirits should raise up clouds between us, call to mind what I   have said, and what you have seen yourselves. Be sure there are some lying spirits   between us; let us come together as friends and explain to each other what is   misrepresented or misunderstood, the clouds will fly away like morning fog,   and the sun of friendship appear and shine forever bright and clear between   us. My children, it may happen that while you are here occasion may arise to talk   about many things which I do not now particularly mention. The Secretary at   War will always be ready to talk with you, and you are to consider whatever   he says as said by myself. He will also take care of you and see that you are   furnished with all comforts here. TO THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE UNITED STATES:Agreeably to the request of the House of Representatives, communicated in their    resolution of the 16th instant, I proceed to state under the reserve therein    expressed, information received touching an illegal combination of private individuals    against the peace and safety of the Union, and a military expedition planned    by them against the territories of a power in amity with the United States,    with the measures I have pursued for suppressing the same.I had for some time been in the constant expectation of receiving such further    information as would have enabled me to lay before the legislature the termination    as well as the beginning and progress of this scene of depravity, so far it    has been acted on the Ohio and its waters. From this the state and safety of    the lower country might have been estimated on probable grounds, and the delay    was indulged the rather, because no circumstance had yet made it necessary to    call in the aid of the legislative functions. Information now recently communicated    has brought us nearly to the period contemplated. The mass of what I have received,    in the course of these transactions, is voluminous, but little has been given    under the sanction of an oath, so as to constitute formal and legal evidence.    It is chiefly in the form of letters, often containing such a mixture of rumors,    conjectures, and suspicions, as render it difficult to sift out the real facts,    and unadvisable to hazard more than general outlines, strengthened by concurrent    information, or the particular credibility of the relater. In this state of    the evidence, delivered sometimes too under the restriction of private confidence,    neither safety nor justice will permit the exposing names, except that of the    principal actor, whose guilt is placed beyond question.Some time in the latter part of September, I received intimations that designs    were in agitation in the western country, unlawful and unfriendly to the peace    of the Union; and that the prime mover in these was Aaron Burr, heretofore distinguished    by the favor of his country. The grounds of these intimations being inconclusive,    the objects uncertain, and the fidelity of that country known to be firm, the    only measure taken was to urge the informants to use their best endeavors to    get further insight into the designs and proceedings of the suspected persons,    and to communicate them to me.It was not until the latter part of October, that the objects of the conspiracy    began to be perceived, but still so blended and involved in mystery that nothing    distinct could be singled out for pursuit. In this state of uncertainty as to    the crime contemplated, the acts done, and the legal course to be pursued, I    thought it best to send to the scene where these things were principally in    transaction, a person, in whose integrity, understanding, and discretion, entire    confidence could be reposed, with instructions to investigate the plots going    on, to enter into conference (for which he had sufficient credentials) with    the governors and all other officers, civil and military, and with their aid    to do on the spot whatever should be necessary to discover the designs of the    conspirators, arrest their means, bring their persons to punishment, and to    call out the force of the country to suppress any unlawful enterprise in which    it should be found they were engaged. By this time it was known that many boats    were under preparation, stores of provisions collecting, and an unusual number    of suspicious characters in motion on the Ohio and its waters. Besides despatching    the confidential agent to that quarter, orders were at the same time sent to    the governors of the Orleans and Mississippi territories, and to the commanders    of the land and naval forces there, to be on their guard against surprise, and    in constant readiness to resist any enterprise which might be attempted on the    vessels, posts, or other objects under their care; and on the 8th of November,    instructions were forwarded to General Wilkinson to hasten an accommodation    with the Spanish commander on the Sabine, and as soon as that was effected,    to fall back with his principal force to the hither bank of the Mississippi,    for the defence of the intersecting points on that river. By a letter received    from that officer on the 25th of November, but dated October 21st, we learn    that a confidential agent of Aaron Burr had been deputed to him, with communications    partly written in cipher and partly oral, explaining his designs, exaggerating    his resources, and making such offers of emolument and command, to engage him    and the army in his unlawful enterprise, as he had flattered himself would be    successful. The general, with the honor of a soldier and fidelity of a good    citizen, immediately despatched a trusty officer to me with information of what    had passed, proceeding to establish such an understanding with the Spanish commandant    on the Sabine as permitted him to withdraw his force across the Mississippi,    and to enter on measures for opposing the projected enterprise.The general's letter, which came to hand on the 25th of November, as has been    mentioned, and some other information received a few days earlier, when brought    together, developed Burr's general designs, different parts of which only had    been revealed to different informants. It appeared that he contemplated two    distinct objects, which might be carried on either jointly or separately, and    either the one or the other first, as circumstances should direct. One of these    was the severance of the Union of these States by the Alleghany mountains; the    other, an attack on Mexico. A third object was provided, merely ostensible,    to wit: the settlement of a pretended purchase of a tract of country on the    Washita, claimed by a Baron Bastrop. This was to serve as the pretext for all    his preparations, an allurement for such followers as really wished to acquire    settlements in that country, and a cover under which to retreat in the event    of final discomfiture of both branches of his real design.He found at once that the attachment of the western country to the present    Union was not to be shaken; that its dissolution could not be effected with    the consent of its inhabitants, and that his resources were inadequate, as yet,    to effect it by force. He took his course then at once, determined to seize    on New Orleans, plunder the bank there, possess himself of the military and    naval stores, and proceed on his expedition to Mexico; and to this object all    his means and preparations were now directed. He collected from all the quarters    where himself or his agents possessed influence, all the ardent, restless, desperate,    and disaffected persons who were ready for any enterprise analogous to their    characters. He seduced good and well-meaning citizens, some by assurances that    he possessed the confidence of the government and was acting under its secret    patronage, a pretence which obtained some credit from the state of our differences    with Spain; and others by offers of land in Bastrop's claim on the Washita.This was the state of my information of his proceedings about the last of November,    at which time, therefore, it was first possible to take specific measures to    meet them. The proclamation of November 27, two days after the receipt of    General Wilkinson's information, was now issued. Orders were despatched to every    intersecting point on the Ohio and Mississippi, from Pittsburg to New Orleans,    for the employment of such force either of the regulars or of the militia, and    of such proceedings also of the civil authorities, as might enable them to seize    on all the boats and stores provided for the enterprise, to arrest the persons    concerned, and to suppress effectually the further progress of the enterprise.    A little before the receipt of these orders in the State of Ohio, our confidential    agent, who had been diligently employed in investigating the conspiracy, had    acquired sufficient information to open himself to the governor of that State,    and apply for the immediate exertion of the authority and power of the State    to crush the combination. Governor Tiffin and the legislature, with a promptitude,    an energy, and patriotic zeal, which entitle them to a distinguished place in    the affection of their sister States, effected the seizure of all the boats,    provisions, and other preparations within their reach, and thus gave a first    blow, materially disabling the enterprise in its outset.In Kentucky, a premature attempt to bring Burr to justice, without sufficient    evidence for his conviction, had produced a popular impression in his favor,    and a general disbelief of his guilt. This gave him an unfortunate opportunity    of hastening his equipments. The arrival of the proclamation and orders, and    the application and information of our confidential agent, at length awakened    the authorities of that State to the truth, and then produced the same promptitude    and energy of which the neighboring State had set the example. Under an act    of their legislature of December 23, militia was instantly ordered to different    important points, and measures taken for doing whatever could yet be done. Some    boats (accounts vary from five to double or treble that number) and persons    (differently estimated from one to three hundred) had in the meantime passed    the falls of the Ohio, to rendezvous at the mouth of the Cumberland, with others    expected down that river.Not apprized, till very late, that any boats were building on Cumberland, the    effect of the proclamation had been trusted to for some time in the State of    Tennessee; but on the 19th of December, similar communications and instructions    with those of the neighboring States were despatched by express to the governor,    and a general officer of the western division of the State, and on the 23rd of    December our confidential agent left Frankfort for Nashville, to put into activity    the means of that State also. But by information received yesterday I learn    that on the 22rd of December, Mr. Burr descended the Cumberland with two boats    merely of accommodation, carrying with him from that State no quota toward his    unlawful enterprise. Whether after the arrival of the proclamation, of the orders,    or of our agent, any exertion which could be made by that State, or the orders    of the governor of Kentucky for calling out the militia at the mouth of Cumberland,    would be in time to arrest these boats, and those from the falls of the Ohio,    is still doubtful.On the whole, the fugitives from Ohio, with their associates from Cumberland,    or any other place in that quarter, cannot threaten serious danger to the city    of New Orleans.By the same express of December nineteenth, orders were sent to the governors    of New Orleans and Mississippi, supplementary to those which had been given    on the 25th of November, to hold the militia of their territories in    readiness to co-operate for their defence, with the regular troops and armed    vessels then under command of General Wilkinson. Great alarm, indeed, was excited    at New Orleans by the exaggerated accounts of Mr. Burr, disseminated through    his emissaries, of the armies and navies he was to assemble there. General Wilkinson    had arrived there himself on the 24th of November and had immediately put into    activity the resources of the place for the purpose of its defence; and on the    tenth of December he was joined by his troops from the Sabine. Great zeal was    shown by the inhabitants generally, the merchants of the place readily agreeing    to the most laudable exertions and sacrifices for manning the armed vessels    with their seamen, and the other citizens manifesting unequivocal fidelity to    the Union, and a spirit of determined resistance to their expected assailants.Surmises have been hazarded that this enterprise is to receive aid from certain    foreign powers. But these surmises are without proof or probability. The wisdom    of the measures sanctioned by Congress at its last session had placed us in    the paths of peace and justice with the only powers with whom we had any differences,    and nothing has happened since which makes it either their interest or ours    to pursue another course. No change of measures has taken place on our part;    none ought to take place at this time. With the one, friendly arrangement was    then proposed, and the law deemed necessary on the failure of that was suspended    to give time for a fair trial of the issue. With the same power, negotiation    is still preferred and provisional measures only are necessary to meet the event    of rupture. While, therefore, we do not deflect in the slightest degree from    the course we then assumed, and are still pursuing, with mutual consent, to    restore a good understanding, we are not to impute to them practices as irreconcilable    to interest as to good faith, and changing necessarily the relations of peace    and justice between us to those of war. These surmises are, therefore, to be    imputed to the vauntings of the author of this enterprise, to multiply his partisans    by magnifying the belief of his prospects and support.By letters from General Wilkinson, of the 14th and 18th of September, which    came to hand two days after date of the resolution of the House of Representatives,    that is to say, on the morning of the 18th instant, I received the important    affidavit, a copy of which I now communicate, with extracts of so much of the    letters as come within the scope of the resolution. By these it will be seen    that of three of the principal emissaries of Mr. Burr, whom the general had    caused to be apprehended, one had been liberated by , and the    two others, being those particularly employed in the endeavor to corrupt the    general and army of the United States, have been embarked by him for our ports    in the Atlantic States, probably on the consideration that an impartial trial    could not be expected during the present agitations of New Orleans, and that    that city was not as yet a safe place of confinement. As soon as these persons    shall arrive, they will be delivered to the custody of the law, and left to    such course of trial, both as to place and process, as its functionaries may    direct. The presence of the highest judicial authorities, to be assembled at    this place within a few days, the means of pursuing a sounder course of proceedings    here than elsewhere, and the aid of the executive means, should the judges have    occasion to use them, render it equally desirable for the criminals as for the    public, that being already removed from the place where they were first apprehended,    the first regular arrest should take place here, and the course of proceedings    receive here its proper direction. TO THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE UNITED STATES          In compliance with the request of the House of Representatives, expressed in   their resolution of the 5th instant, I proceed to give such information as is   possessed, of the effect of gun-boats in the protection and defense of harbors,   of the numbers thought necessary, and of the proposed distribution of them among   the ports and harbors of the United States. Under the present circumstances, and governed by the intentions of the legislature,   as manifested by their annual appropriations of money for the purposes of defence,   it has been concluded to combine -- 1st, land batteries, furnished with heavy   cannon and mortars, and established on all the points around the place favorable   for preventing vessels from lying before it; 2d, movable artillery which may   be carried, as an occasion may require, to points unprovided with fixed batteries;   3d, floating batteries; and 4th, gun-boats, which may oppose an enemy at its   entrance and co-operate with the batteries for his expulsion. On this subject professional men were consulted as far as we had opportunity.   General Wilkinson, and the late General Gates, gave their opinions in writing,   in favor of the system, as will be seen by their letters now communicated. The   higher officers of the navy gave the same opinions in separate conferences,   as their presence at the seat of government offered occasions of consulting   them, and no difference of judgment appeared on the subjects. Those of Commodore   Barron and Captain Tingey, now here, are recently furnished in writing, and   transmitted herewith to the legislature. The efficacy of gun-boats for the defence of harbors, and of other smooth and   enclosed waters, may be estimated in part from that of galleys, formerly much   used, but less powerful, more costly in their construction and maintenance,   and requiring more men. But the gun-boat itself is believed to be in use with   every modern maritime nation for the purpose of defence. In the Mediterranean,   on which are several small powers, whose system like ours is peace and defence,   few harbors are without this article of protection. Our own experience there   of the effect of gun-boats for harbor service, is recent. Algiers is particularly   known to have owed to a great provision of these vessels the safety of its city,   since the epoch of their construction. Before that it had been repeatedly insulted   and injured. The effect of gun-boats at present in the neighborhood of Gibraltar,   is well known, and how much they were used both in the attack and defence of   that place during a former war. The extensive resort to them by the two greatest   naval powers in the world, on an enterprise of invasion not long since in prospect,   shows their confidence in their efficacy for the purposes for which they are   suited. By the northern powers of Europe, whose seas are particularly adapted   to them, they are still more used. The remarkable action between the Russian   flotilla of gun-boats and galleys, and a Turkish fleet of ships-of-the-line   and frigates, in the Liman sea, 1788, will be readily recollected. The latter,   commanded by their most celebrated admiral, were completely defeated, and several   of their ships-of-the-line destroyed. From the opinions given as to the number of gun-boats necessary for some of   the principal seaports, and from a view of all the towns and ports from Orleans   to Maine inclusive, entitled to protection, in proportion to their situation   and circumstances, it is concluded, that to give them a due measure of protection   in time of war, about two hundred gun-boats will be requisite. According to   first ideas, the following would be their general distribution, liable to be   varied on more mature examination, and as circumstances shall vary, that is   to say: -- To the Mississippi and its neighboring waters, forty gun-boats. To Savannah and Charleston, and the harbors on each side, from St. Mary's to   Currituck, twenty-five. To the Chesapeake and its waters, twenty. To Delaware bay and river, fifteen. To New York, the Sound, and waters as far as Cape Cod, fifty. To Boston and the harbors north of Cape Cod, fifty.   The flotilla assigned to these several stations, might each be under the care   of a particular commandant, and the vessels composing them would, in ordinary,   be distributed among the harbors within the station in proportion to their importance. Of these boats a proper proportion would be of the larger size, such as those   heretofore built, capable of navigating any seas, and of reinforcing occasionally   the strength of even the most distant port when menaced with danger. The residue   would be confined to their own or the neighboring harbors, would be smaller,   less furnished for accommodation, and consequently less costly. Of the number   supposed necessary, seventy-three are built or building, and the hundred and   twenty-seven still to be provided, would cost from five to six hundred thousand   dollars. Having regard to the convenience of the treasury, as well as to the   resources of building, it has been thought that one half of these might be built   in the present year, and the other half the next. With the legislature, however,   it will rest to stop where we are, or at any further point, when they shall   be of opinion that the number provided shall be sufficient for the object. At times when Europe as well as the United States shall be at peace, it would   not be proposed that more than six or eight of these vessels should be kept   afloat. When Europe is in war, treble that number might be necessary to be distributed   among those particular harbors which foreign vessels of war are in the habit   of frequenting, for the purpose of preserving order therein. But they would be manned, in ordinary, with only their complement for navigation,   relying on the seamen and militia of the port if called into action on sudden   emergency. It would be only when the United States should themselves be at war,   that the whole number would be brought into actual service, and would be ready   in the first moments of the war to co-operate with other means for covering   at once the line of our seaports. At all times, those unemployed would be withdrawn   into places not exposed to sudden enterprise, hauled up under sheds from the   sun and weather, and kept in preservation with little expense for repairs or   maintenance. It must be superfluous to observe, that this species of naval armament is proposed   merely for defensive operation; that it can have but little effect toward protecting   our commerce in the open seas even on our coast; and still less can it become   an excitement to engage in offensive maritime war, toward which it would furnish   no means. During the wars which for some time have unhappily prevailed among the powers of Europe the United States of America, firm in their principles of peace, have endeavored, by justice, by a regular discharge of all their national and social duties, and by every friendly office their situation has admitted, to maintain with all the belligerents their accustomed relations of friendship, hospitality, and commercial intercourse. Taking no part in the questions which animate these powers against each other, nor permitting themselves to entertain a wish but for the restoration of general peace, they have observed with good faith the neutrality they assumed, and they believe that no instance of a departure from its duties can be justly imputed to them by any nation. A free use of their harbors and waters, the means of refitting and of refreshment, of succor to their sick and suffering, have at all times and on equal principles been extended to all, and this, too, amidst a constant recurrence of acts of insubordination to the laws, of violence to the persons, and of trespasses on the property of our citizens committed by officers of one of the belligerent parties received among us. In truth, these abuses of the laws of hospitality have, with few exceptions, become habitual to the commanders of the British armed vessels hovering on our coasts and frequenting our harbors. They have been the subject of repeated representations to their Government. Assurances have been given that proper orders should restrain them within the limits of the rights and of the respect due to a friendly nation; but those orders and assurances have been without effect--no instance of punishment for past wrongs has taken place. At length a deed transcending all we have hitherto seen or suffered brings the public sensibility to a serious crisis and our forbearance to a necessary pause. A frigate of the United States, trusting to a state of peace, and leaving her harbor on a distant service, has been surprised and attacked by a British vessel of superior force--one of a squadron then lying in our waters and covering the transaction--and has been disabled from service, with the loss of a number of men killed and wounded. This enormity was not only without provocation or justifiable cause, but was committed with the avowed purpose of taking by force from a ship of war of the United States a part of her crew; and that no circumstance might be wanting to mark its character, it had been previously ascertained that the seamen demanded were native citizens of the United States. Having effected her purpose, she returned to anchor with her squadron within our jurisdiction. Hospitality under such circumstances ceases to be a duty, and a continuance of it with such uncontrolled abuses would tend only, by multiplying injuries and irritations, to bring on a rupture between the two nations. This extreme resort is equally opposed to the interests of both, as it is to assurances of the most friendly dispositions on the part of the British Government, in the midst of which this outrage has been committed. In this light the subject can not but present itself to that Government and strengthen the motives to an honorable reparation of the wrong which has been done, and to that effectual control of its naval commanders which alone can justify the Government of the United States in the exercise of those hospitalities it is now constrained to discontinue.In consideration of these circumstances and of the right of every nation to regulate its own police, to provide for its peace and for the safety of its citizens, and consequently to refuse the admission of armed vessels into its harbors or waters, either in such numbers or of such descriptions as are inconsistent with these or with the maintenance of the authority of the laws, I have thought proper, in pursuance of the authorities specially given by law, to issue this my proclamation, hereby requiring all armed vessels bearing commissions under the Government of Great Britain now within the harbors or waters of the United States immediately and without any delay to depart from the same, and interdicting the entrance of all the said harbors and waters to the said armed vessels and to all others bearing commissions under the authority Of the British Government.And if the said vessels, or any of them, shall fall to depart as aforesaid, or if they or any others so interdicted shall hereafter enter the harbors or waters aforesaid, I do in that case forbid all intercourse with them, or any of them, their officers or crews, and do prohibit all supplies and aid from being furnished to them, or any of them.And I do declare and make known that if any person from or within the jurisdictional limits of the United States shall afford any aid to any such vessel contrary to the prohibition contained in this proclamation, either in repairing any such vessel or in furnishing her, her officers or crew, with supplies of any kind or in any manner whatsoever; or if any pilot shall assist in navigating any of the said armed vessels, unless it be for the purpose of carrying them in the first instance beyond the limits and jurisdiction of the United States, or unless it be in the case of a vessel forced by distress or charged with public dispatches, as hereinafter provided for, such person or persons shall on conviction suffer all the pains and penalties by the laws provided for such offenses.And I do hereby enjoin and require all persons bearing office, civil or military, within or under the authority of the United States, and all others citizens or inhabitants thereof, or being within the same, with vigilance and promptitude to exert their respective authorities and to be aiding and assisting to the carrying this proclamation and every part thereof into full effect.Provided, nevertheless, that if any such vessel shall be forced into the harbors or waters of the United States by distress, by the dangers of the sea, or by the pursuit of an enemy, or shall enter them charged with dispatches or business from their Government, or shall be a public packet for the conveyance of letters and dispatches, the commanding officer, immediately reporting his vessel to the collector of the district, stating the object or causes of entering the said harbors or waters, and conforming himself to the regulations in that case prescribed under the authority of the laws, shall be allowed the benefit of such regulations respecting repairs, supplies, stay, intercourse, and departure as shall be permitted under the same authority.In testimony whereof I have caused the seal of the United States to be affixed to these presents, and signed the same.Given at the city of Washington, the 2d day of July, A. D. 1807, and of the Sovereignty and Independence of the United States the thirty-first.TH: JEFFERSON.By the President:JAMES MADISON, Secretary of State.  To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States:          Circumstances, fellow-citizens, which seriously threatened the peace of our   country have made it a duty to convene you at an earlier period than usual.   The love of peace so much cherished in the bosoms of our citizens, which has   so long guided the proceedings of their public councils and induced forbearance   under so many wrongs, may not insure our continuance in the quiet pursuits of   industry. The many injuries and depredations committed on our commerce and navigation   upon the high seas for years past, the successive innovations on those principles   of public law which have been established by the reason and usage of nations   and peace, and all the circumstances which induced the extraordinary mission   to London are already known to you. The instructions given to our ministers   were framed in the sincerest spirit of amity and moderation. They accordingly   proceeded, in conformity therewith, to propose arrangements which might embrace   and settle all the points in difference between us to a mutual understanding   on our neutral and national rights provide for a commercial intercourse on conditions   of some equality. After long and fruitless endeavors to effect the purposes   of their mission and to obtain arrangements within the limits of their instructions,   they concluded to sign such as could be obtained and to send them for consideration,   candidly declaring to the other negotiations at the same time that they were   acting against their instructions, and that their Government, therefore, could   not be pledged for ratification. Some of the articles proposed might have been   admitted on a principle of compromise, but others were too highly disadvantageous,   and no sufficient provision was made against the principle source of the irritations   and collisions which were constantly endangering the peace of the two nations.   The question, therefore, whether a treaty should be accepted in that form could   have admitted but of one decision, even had no declarations of the other party   impaired our confidence in it. Still anxious not to close the door against friendly   adjustment, new modifications were framed and further concessions authorized   than could before have been supposed necessary; and our ministers were instructed   to resume their negotiations on these grounds. On this new reference to amicable   discussion we were reposing in confidence, when on the 22d day of June last   by a formal order from British admiral the frigate Cheapeake, leaving her port   for a distant service, was attacked by one of those vessels which had been lying   in our harbors under the indulgences of hospitality, was disabled from proceeding,   had several of her crew killed and four taken away. On this outrage no commentaries   are necessary. Its character has been pronounced by the indignant voice of our   citizens with an emphasis and unanimity never exceeded. I immediately, by proclamation,   interdicted our harbors and waters to all British armed vessels, forbade intercourse   with them, and uncertain how far hostilities were intended, and the town of   Norfolk, indeed being threatened with immediate attack, a sufficient force was   ordered for the protection of that place, and such other preparations commenced   and pursued as the prospect rendered proper. An armed vessel of the United States   was dispatched with instructions to our ministers at London to call on that   Government for the satisfaction and security required by the outrage. A very   short interval ought now to bring the answer, which shall be communicated to   you as soon as received; then also, or as soon after as the public interests   shall be found to admit; the unratified treaty and proceedings relative to it   shall be made known to you.The aggression thus begun has been continued on the part of the British commanders   by remaining within our waters in defiance of the authority of the country,   by habitual violations of its jurisdiction, and at length by putting to death   one of the persons whom they had forcibly taken from on board the Chesapeake.   These aggravations necessarily lead to the policy either of never admitting   an armed vessel into our harbors or of maintaining in every harbor such an armed   force as may constrain obedience to the laws and protect the lives and property   of our citizens against their armed guests; but the expense of such a standing   force and its inconsistence with our principles dispense with those courtesies   which would necessarily call for it, and leave us equally free to exclude the   navy, as we are the army, of a foreign power from entering our limits.To former violations of maritime rights another is now added of very extensive   effect. The Government of that nation has issued an order interdicting all trade   by neutrals between ports not in amity with them; and being now at war with   nearly every nation on the Atlantic and Mediterranean seas, our vessels are   required to sacrifice their cargos at the first port they touch or to return   home without the benefit of going to any other market. Under this new law of   the ocean our trade on the Mediterranean has been swept away by seizures and   condemnations, and that in other seas is threatened with the same fate.Our differences with Spain remain still unsettled, no measure having been taken   on her part since my last communications to Congress to bring them to a close.   But under a state of things which may favor reconsideration they have been recently   pressed, and an expectation is entertained that they may now soon be brought   to an issue of some sort. With their subjects on our borders no new collisions   have taken place nor seem immediately to be apprehended. To our former grounds   of complaint has been added a very serious one, as you will see by the decree   a copy of which is now communicated. Whether this decree, which professed to   be conformable to that of the French Government of November 21, 1806, heretofore   communicated to Congress, will also be conformed to that in its construction   and application in relation to the United States had not been ascertained at   the date of our last communications. These, however, gave reason to expect such   a conformity.With the other nations of Europe our harmony has ben uninterrupted, and commerce   and friendly intercourse have been maintained on their usual footing.Our peace with the several states on the coast of Barbary appears as firm as   at any former period and as likely to continue as that of any other nation.Among our Indian neighbors in the northwestern quarter some fermentation was   observed soon after the late occurences, threatening the continuance of our   peace. Messages were said to be interchanged and tokens to be passing, which   usually denote a state of restlessness among them, and the character of the   agitators pointed to the sources of excitement. Measures were immediately taken   for providing against that danger; instructions were given to require explanations,   and, with assurances of our continued friendship, to admonish the tribes to   remain quiet at home, taking no part in quarrels not belonging o them. As far   as we are yet informed, the tribes in our vicinity, who are most advanced in   the pursuits of industry, are sincerely disposed to adhere to their friendship   with us and to their peace with all others, while those more remote do not present   appearances sufficiently quiet to justify the intermission of military precaution   on our part.The great tribes on our southwestern quarter, much advanced beyond the others   in agriculture and household arts, appear tranquil and identifying their views   with ours in proportion to their advancement. With the whole of these people,   in every quarter, I shall continue to inculcate peace and friendship with all   their neighbors and perseverance in those occupations and pursuits which will   best promote their own well-being.The appropriations of the last session for the defense of our seaport towns   and harbors were made under expectation that a continuance of peace would permit   us to proceed in that work according to our convenience. It has been thought   better to apply the sums then given toward the defense of New York, Charleston,   and New Orleans chiefly as most open and most likely first to need protection,   and to leave places less immediately in danger to the provisions of the present   session.The gunboats, too already provided have on a like principle been chiefly assigned   to New York, New Orleans, and the Chesapeake. Whether our movable force on th   e water, so material in aid of the defensive works on the land, should be augmented   in this or any other form is left to the wisdom of the Legislature. For the   purpose of manning these vessels in sudden attacks on our harbors it is a matter   for consideration whether the seamen of the United States may not justly be   formed into a special militia, to be called on for tours of duty in defense   of the harbors where they shall happen to be, the ordinary militia of the place   furnishing that portion which may consist of landsmen.The moment our peace was threatened I deemed it indispensable to secure a greater   provision of those articles of military stores with which our magazines were   not sufficiently furnished. To have awaited a previous and special sanction   by law would have lost occasions which might not be retrieved. I did not hesitate,   therefore to authorize engagements for such supplements to our existing stock   would render it adequate to the emergencies threatening us, and I trust that   the legislature, feeling the same anxiety for the safety of our country, so   materially advanced by this precaution, will approve, when done, what they would   have seen so important to be done if then assembled. Expenses, also unprovided   for, arose out of the necessity of calling all our gunboats into actual service   for the defense of our harbors; of all which accounts will be laid before you.When a regular army is to be raised, and to what extent, must depend on the   information so shortly expected. In the meantime I have called on the States   for quotas of militia, to be in readiness for present defense, and have, moreover,   encouraged the acceptance of volunteers; and I am happy to inform you that these   have offered themselves with great alacrity in every part of the Union. They   are ordered to be organized and ready at a moment's warning to proceed on any   service to which they may be called, and every preparation within the Executive   powers has been made to insure us the benefit of earl exertions.I informed Congress at their last session of the enterprises against the public   peace which were believed to be in preparation by Aaron Burr and his associates,   of the measures taken to defeat them and to bring the offenders to justice.   Their enterprises were happily defeated by the patriotic exertions of the militias   whenever called into action, by the fidelity of the Army, and energy of the   commander in chief in promptly arranging the difficulties presenting themselves   on the Sabine, repairing to meet those arising on the Mississippi , and dissipating   before their explosion plots engendering there. I shall think it my duty to   lay before you the proceedings and the evidence publicly exhibited on the arraignment   of the principle offenders before the circuit court of Virginia. You will be   enabled to judge whether the defect was in the testimony, in the law, or in   the administration of the law; and whenever it shall be found, the Legislation   alone can apply or originate the remedy. The framers of our Constitution certainly   supposed they had guarded as well their Government against destruction by treason   as their citizens against oppression under pretense of it, and if these ends   are not attained it is of importance to inquire by what means more effectual   they may be secured.The accounts of the receipts of revenue during the year ending on the 30th   day of September last being not yet made up, a correct statement will be hereafter   transmitted from the Treasury. In the meantime, it is ascertained that the receipts   have amounted to near $16,000,000which, with the five millions and a half in   the Treasury at the beginning of the year, have enabled us, after meeting the   current demands and interest incurred, to pay more than four millions of the   principle of our funded debt. These payments, with those of the preceding five   and a half years, have extinguished of the funded debt $25,500,000, being the   whole which could be paid or purchased within the limits of the law and of our   contracts, and have left us in the Treasury $8,500,000. A portion of this sum   may be considered as a commencement of accumulation of the surpluses of revenue   which after paying the installments of debt as they shall become payable, will   remain without any specific object. It may partly, indeed, be applied toward   completing the defense of the exposed points of our country, on such a scale   as shall be adapted to our principles and circumstances. This object is doubtless   among the first entitled to attention in such a state of our finances, and it   is one which, whether we have peace or war, will provide security where it is   due. Whether what shall remain of this, with the future surpluses, may be usefully   applied to purposes already authorized or more usefully to others requiring   new authorities, or how otherwise they shall be disposed of, are questions calling   for the notice of Congress, unless, indeed, they shall be superceded by a change   in our public relations now awaiting the determination of others. Whatever be   that determination, it is a great consolation that it will become known at a   moment when the supreme council of the nation is assembled at its post, and   ready to give the aids of its wisdom and authority to whatever course the good   of our country shall then call us to pursue.Matters of minor importance will be the subjects of future communications,   and nothing shall be wanting on my part which may give information or dispatch   to the proceedings of the Legislature in the excercise of their high duties,   and at a moment so interesting to the public welfare.  TO THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE UNITED STATES:          It would have been a source, fellow citizens, of much gratification, if our   last communications from Europe had enabled me to inform you that the belligerent   nations, whose disregard of neutral rights has been so destructive to our commerce,   had become awakened to the duty and true policy of revoking their unrighteous   edicts. That no means might be omitted to produce this salutary effect, I lost   no time in availing myself of the act authorizing a suspension, in whole or   in part, of the several embargo laws. Our ministers at London and Paris were   instructed to explain to the respective governments there, our disposition to   exercise the authority in such manner as would withdraw the pretext on which   the aggressions were originally founded, and open a way for a renewal of that   commercial intercourse which it was alleged on all sides had been reluctantly   obstructed. As each of those governments had pledged its readiness to concur   in renouncing a measure which reached its adversary through the incontestable   rights of neutrals only, and as the measure had been assumed by each as a retaliation   for an asserted acquiescence in the aggressions of the other, it was reasonably   expected that the occasion would have been seized by both for evincing the sincerity   of their profession, and for restoring to the commerce of the United States   its legitimate freedom. The instructions to our ministers with respect to the   different belligerents were necessarily modified with reference to their different   circumstances, and to the condition annexed by law to the executive power of   suspension, requiring a degree of security to our commerce which would not result   from a repeal of the decrees of France. Instead of a pledge, therefore, of a   suspension of the embargo as to her in case of such a repeal, it was presumed   that a sufficient inducement might be found in other considerations, and particularly   in the change produced by a compliance with our just demands by one belligerent,   and a refusal by the other, in the relations between the other and the United   States. To Great Britain, whose power on the ocean is so ascendant, it was deemed   not inconsistent with that condition to state explicitly, that on her rescinding   her orders in relation to the United States their trade would be opened with   her, and remain shut to her enemy, in case of his failure to rescind his decrees   also. From France no answer has been received, nor any indication that the requisite   change in her decrees is contemplated. The favorable reception of the proposition   to Great Britain was the less to be doubted, as her orders of council had not   only been referred for their vindication to an acquiescence on the part of the   United States no longer to be pretended, but as the arrangement proposed, while   it resisted the illegal decrees of France, involved, moreover, substantially,   the precise advantages professedly aimed at by the British orders. The arrangement   has nevertheless been rejected.This candid and liberal experiment having thus failed, and no other event having   occurred on which a suspension of the embargo by the executive was authorized,   it necessarily remains in the extent originally given to it. We have the satisfaction,   however, to reflect, that in return for the privations by the measure, and which   our fellow citizens in general have borne with patriotism, it has had the important   effects of saving our mariners and our vast mercantile property, as well as   of affording time for prosecuting the defensive and provisional measures called   for by the occasion. It has demonstrated to foreign nations the moderation and   firmness which govern our councils, and to our citizens the necessity of uniting   in support of the laws and the rights of their country, and has thus long frustrated   those usurpations and spoliations which, if resisted, involve war; if submitted   to, sacrificed a vital principle of our national independence.Under a continuance of the belligerent measures which, in defiance of laws   which consecrate the rights of neutrals, overspread the ocean with danger, it   will rest with the wisdom of Congress to decide on the course best adapted to   such a state of things; and bringing with them, as they do, from every part   of the Union, the sentiments of our constituents, my confidence is strengthened,   that in forming this decision they will, with an unerring regard to the essential   rights and interests of the nation, weigh and compare the painful alternatives   out of which a choice is to be made. Nor should I do justice to the virtues   which on other occasions have marked the character of our fellow citizens, if   I did not cherish an equal confidence that the alternative chosen, whatever   it may be, will be maintained with all the fortitude and patriotism which the   crisis ought to inspire.The documents containing the correspondences on the subject of the foreign   edicts against our commerce, with the instructions given to our ministers at   London and Paris, are now laid before you.The communications made to Congress at their last session explained the posture   in which the close of the discussion relating to the attack by a British ship   of war on the frigate Chesapeake left a subject on which the nation had manifested   so honorable a sensibility. Every view of what had passed authorized a belief   that immediate steps would be taken by the British government for redressing   a wrong, which, the more it was investigated, appeared the more clearly to require   what had not been provided for in the special mission. It is found that no steps   have been taken for the purpose. On the contrary, it will be seen, in the documents   laid before you, that the inadmissible preliminary which obstructed the adjustment   is still adhered to; and, moreover, that it is now brought into connection with   the distinct and irrelative case of the orders in council. The instructions   which had been given to our ministers at London with a view to facilitate, if   necessary, the reparation claimed by the United States, are included in the   documents communicated.Our relations with the other powers of Europe have undergone no material changes   since your last session. The important negotiations with Spain, which had been   alternately suspended and resumed, necessarily experience a pause under the   extraordinary and interesting crisis which distinguished her internal situation.With the Barbary powers we continue in harmony, with the exception of an unjustifiable   proceeding of the dey of Algiers toward our consul to that regency. Its character   and circumstances are now laid before you, and will enable you to decide how   far it may, either now or hereafter, call for any measures not within the limits   of the executive authority.With our Indian neighbors the public peace has been steadily maintained. Some   instances of individual wrong have, as at other times, taken place, but in nowise   implicating the will of the nation. Beyond the Mississippi, the Iowas, the Sacs,   and the Alabamas, have delivered up for trial and punishment individuals from   among themselves accused of murdering citizens of the United States. On this   side of the Mississippi, the Creeks are exerting themselves to arrest offenders   of the same kind; and the Choctaws have manifested their readiness and desire   for amicable and just arrangements respecting depredations committed by disorderly   persons of their tribe. And, generally, from a conviction that we consider them   as part of ourselves, and cherish with sincerity their rights and interests,   the attachment of the Indian tribes is gaining strength daily -- is extending   from the nearer to the more remote, and will amply requite us for the justice   and friendship practised towards them. Husbandry and household manufacture are   advancing among them, more rapidly with the southern than the northern tribes,   from circumstances of soil and climate; and one of the two great divisions of   the Cherokee nation have now under consideration to solicit the citizenship   of the United States, and to be identified with us in laws and government, in   such progressive manner as we shall think best.In consequence of the appropriations of the last session of Congress for the   security of our seaport towns and harbors, such works of defence have been erected   as seemed to be called for by the situation of the several places, their relative   importance, and the scale of expense indicated by the amount of the appropriation.   These works will chiefly be finished in the course of the present season, except   at New York and New Orleans, where most was to be done; and although a great   proportion of the last appropriation has been expended on the former place,   yet some further views will be submitted by Congress for rendering its security   entirely adequate against naval enterprise. A view of what has been done at   the several places, and of what is proposed to be done, shall be communicated   as soon as the several reports are received.Of the gun-boats authorized by the act of December last, it has been thought   necessary to build only one hundred and three in the present year. These, with   those before possessed, are sufficient for the harbors and waters exposed, and   the residue will require little time for their construction when it is deemed   necessary.Under the act of the last session for raising an additional military force,   so many officers were immediately appointed as were necessary for carrying on   the business of recruiting, and in proportion as it advanced, others have been   added. We have reason to believe their success has been satisfactory, although   such returns have not yet been received as enable me to present to you a statement   of the numbers engaged.I have not thought it necessary in the course of the last season to call for   any general detachments of militia or volunteers under the law passed for that   purpose. For the ensuing season, however, they will require to be in readiness   should their services be wanted. Some small and special detachments have been   necessary to maintain the laws of embargo on that portion of our northern frontier   which offered peculiar facilities for evasion, but these were replaced as soon   as it could be done by bodies of new recruits. By the aid of these, and of the   armed vessels called into actual service in other quarters, the spirit of disobedience   and abuse which manifested itself early, and with sensible effect while we were   unprepared to meet it, has been considerably repressed.Considering the extraordinary character of the times in which we live, our   attention should unremittingly be fixed on the safety of our country. For a   people who are free, and who mean to remain so, a well-organized and armed militia   is their best security. It is, therefore, incumbent on us, at every meeting,   to revise the condition of the militia, and to ask ourselves if it is prepared   to repel a powerful enemy at every point of our territories exposed to invasion.   Some of the States have paid a laudable attention to this object; but every   degree of neglect is to be found among others. Congress alone have power to   produce a uniform state of preparation in this great organ of defence; the interests   which they so deeply feel in their own and their country's security will present   this as among the most important objects of their deliberation.Under the acts of March 11th and April 23d, respecting arms, the difficulty   of procuring them from abroad, during the present situation and dispositions   of Europe, induced us to direct our whole efforts to the means of internal supply.   The public factories have, therefore, been enlarged, additional machineries   erected, and in proportion as artificers can be found or formed, their effect,   already more than doubled, may be increased so as to keep pace with the yearly   increase of the militia. The annual sums appropriated by the latter act, have   been directed to the encouragement of private factories of arms, and contracts   have been entered into with individual undertakers to nearly the amount of the   first year's appropriation.The suspension of our foreign commerce, produced by the injustice of the belligerent   powers, and the consequent losses and sacrifices of our citizens, are subjects   of just concern. The situation into which we have thus been forced, has impelled   us to apply a portion of our industry and capital to internal manufactures and   improvements. The extent of this conversion is daily increasing, and little   doubt remains that the establishments formed and forming will -- under the auspices   of cheaper materials and subsistence, the freedom of labor from taxation with   us, and of protecting duties and prohibitions -- become permanent. The commerce   with the Indians, too, within our own boundaries, is likely to receive abundant   aliment from the same internal source, and will secure to them peace and the   progress of civilization, undisturbed by practices hostile to both.The accounts of the receipts and expenditures during the year ending on the   30th day of September last, being not yet made up, a correct statement will   hereafter be transmitted from the Treasury. In the meantime, it is ascertained   that the receipts have amounted to near eighteen millions of dollars, which,   with the eight millions and a half in the treasury at the beginning of the year,   have enabled us, after meeting the current demands and interest incurred, to   pay two millions three hundred thousand dollars of the principal of our funded   debt, and left us in the treasury, on that day, near fourteen millions of dollars.   Of these, five millions three hundred and fifty thousand dollars will be necessary   to pay what will be due on the first day of January next, which will complete   the reimbursement of the eight per cent. stock. These payments, with those made   in the six years and a half preceding, will have extinguished thirty-three millions   five hundred and eighty thousand dollars of the principal of the funded debt,   being the whole which could be paid or purchased within the limits of the law   and our contracts; and the amount of principal thus discharged will have liberated   the revenue from about two millions of dollars of interest, and added that sum   annually to the disposable surplus. The probable accumulation of the surpluses   of revenue beyond what can be applied to the payment of the public debt, whenever   the freedom and safety of our commerce shall be restored, merits the consideration   of Congress. Shall it lie unproductive in the public vaults? Shall the revenue   be reduced? Or shall it rather be appropriated to the improvements of roads,   canals, rivers, education, and other great foundations of prosperity and union,   under the powers which Congress may already possess, or such amendment of the   constitution as may be approved by the States? While uncertain of the course   of things, the time may be advantageously employed in obtaining the powers necessary   for a system of improvement, should that be thought best.Availing myself of this the last occasion which will occur of addressing the   two houses of the legislature at their meeting, I cannot omit the expression   of my sincere gratitude for the repeated proofs of confidence manifested to   me by themselves and their predecessors since my call to the administration,   and the many indulgences experienced at their hands. The same grateful acknowledgments   are due to my fellow citizens generally, whose support has been my great encouragement   under all embarrassments. In the transaction of their business I cannot have   escaped error. It is incident to our imperfect nature. But I may say with truth,   my errors have been of the understanding, not of intention; and that the advancement   of their rights and interests has been the constant motive for every measure.   On these considerations I solicit their indulgence. Looking forward with anxiety   to their future destinies, I trust that, in their steady character unshaken   by difficulties, in their love of liberty, obedience to law, and support of   the public authorities, I see a sure guaranty of the permanence of our republic;   and retiring from the charge of their affairs, I carry with me the consolation   of a firm persuasion that Heaven has in store for our beloved country long ages   to come of prosperity and happiness.Returning to the scenes of my birth and early life, to the society of those with whom I was raised, and who have been ever dear to me, I receive, fellow citizens and neighbors, with inexpressible pleasure, the cordial welcome you are so good as to give me. Long absent on duties which the history of a wonderful era made incumbent on those called to them, the pomp, the turmoil, the bustle and splendor of office, have drawn but deeper sighs for the tranquil and irresponsible occupations of private life, for the enjoyment of an affectionate intercourse with you, my neighbors and friends, and the endearments of family love, which nature has given us all, as the sweetener of every hour. For these I gladly lay down the distressing burthen of power, and seek, with my fellow citizens, repose and safety under the watchful cares, the labors, and perplexities of younger and abler minds. The anxieties you express to administer to my happiness, do, of themselves, confer that happiness: and the measure will be complete, if my endeavors to fulfill my duties in the several public stations to which I have been called, have obtained for me the approbation of my country. The part which I have acted on the theatre of public life, has been before them; and to their sentence I submit it: but the testimony of my native country, of the individuals who have known me in private life, to my conduct in its various duties and relations, is the more grateful, as proceeding from eye witnesses and observers, from triers of the vicinage. Of you then, my neighbors, I may ask, in the face of the world, ?whose ox have I taken, or whom have defrauded? Whom have I oppressed, or of whose hand have I received a bribe to blind mine eyes therewith?? On your verdict I rest with conscious security. Your wishes for my happiness are received with just sensibility, and I offer sincere prayers for your own welfare and prosperity. Whereas information has been received that sundry persons, citizens of the United States or residents within the same, are conspiring and confederating together to begin and set on foot, provide, and prepare the means for a military expedition or enterprise against the dominions of Spain; that for this purpose they are fitting out and arming vessels in the western waters of the United States, collecting provisions, arms, military stores, and means; are deceiving and seducing honest and well-meaning citizens, under various pretenses, to engage in their criminal enterprises; are organizing, officering, and arming themselves for the same, contrary to the laws in such cases made and provided:I have therefore thought proper to issue this my proclamation, warning and enjoining all faithful citizens who have been led without due knowledge or consideration to participate in the said unlawful enterprises to withdraw from the same without delay, and commanding all persons whatsoever engaged or concerned in the same to cease all further proceedings therein, as they will answer the contrary at their peril and incur prosecution with all the rigors of the law. And I hereby enjoin and require all officers, civil and military, of the United States, or of any of the States or Territories, and especially all governors and other executive authorities, all judges, justices, and other officers of the peace, all military officers of the Army or Navy of the United States, or officers of the militia, to be vigilant, each within his respective department and according to his functions, in searching out and bringing to condign punishment all persons engaged or concerned in such enterprise, in seizing and detaining, subject to the disposition of the law, all vessels, arms, military stores, or other means provided or providing for the same, and, in general, in preventing the carrying on such expedition or enterprise by all lawful means within their power; and I require all good and faithful citizens and others within the United States to be aiding and assisting herein, and especially in the discovery, apprehension, and bringing to justice of all such offenders, in preventing the execution of their unlawful designs, and in giving information against them to the proper authorities.In testimony whereof I have caused the seal of the United States to be affixed to these presents, and have signed the same with my hand.Given at the city of Washington on the 27th day of November, 1806, and in the year of the Sovereignty of the United States the thirty-first,TH: JEFFERSON.By the President:JAMES MADISON,
