Fellow Citizens of the Senate and the House of Representatives: Among the vicissitudes incident to life, no event could have filled me with   greater anxieties than that of which the notification was transmitted by your   order, and received on the fourteenth day of the present month. On the one hand,   I was summoned by my Country, whose voice I can never hear but with veneration   and love, from a retreat which I had chosen with the fondest predilection, and,   in my flattering hopes, with an immutable decision, as the asylum of my declining   years: a retreat which was rendered every day more necessary as well as more   dear to me, by the addition of habit to inclination, and of frequent interruptions   in my health to the gradual waste committed on it by time. On the other hand,   the magnitude and difficulty of the trust to which the voice of my Country called   me, being sufficient to awaken in the wisest and most experienced of her citizens,   a distrustful scrutiny into his qualification, could not but overwhelm with   dispondence, one, who, inheriting inferior endowments from nature and unpractised   in the duties of civil administration, ought to be peculiarly conscious of his   own deficencies. In this conflict of emotions, all I dare aver, is, that it   has been my faithful study to collect my duty from a just appreciation of every   circumstance, by which it might be affected. All I dare hope, is, that, if in   executing this task I have been too much swayed by a grateful remembrance of   former instances, or by an affectionate sensibility to this transcendent proof,   of the confidence of my fellow-citizens; and have thence too little consulted   my incapacity as well as disinclination for the weighty and untried cares before   me; my error will be palliated by the motives which misled me, and its consequences   be judged by my Country, with some share of the partiality in which they originated.  Such being the impressions under which I have, in obedience to the public   summons, repaired to the present station; it would be peculiarly improper to   omit in this first official Act, my fervent supplications to that Almighty Being   who rules over the Universe, who presides in the Councils of Nations, and whose   providential aids can supply every human defect, that his benediction may consecrate   to the liberties and happiness of the People of the United States, a Government   instituted by themselves for these essential purposes: and may enable every   instrument employed in its administration to execute with success, the functions   allotted to his charge. In tendering this homage to the Great Author of every   public and private good, I assure myself that it expresses your sentiments not   less than my own; nor those of my fellow-citizens at large, less than either.   No People can be bound to acknowledge and adore the invisible hand, which conducts   the Affairs of men more than the People of the United States. Every step, by   which they have advanced to the character of an independent nation, seems to   have been distinguished by some token of providential agency. And in the important   revolution just accomplished in the system of their United Government, the tranquil   deliberations and voluntary consent of so many distinct communities, from which   the event has resulted, cannot be compared with the means by which most Governments   have been established, without some return of pious gratitude along with an   humble anticipation of the future blessings which the past seem to presage.   These reflections, arising out of the present crisis, have forced themselves   too strongly on my mind to be suppressed. You will join with me I trust in thinking,   that there are none under the influence of which, the proceedings of a new and   free Government can more auspiciously commence.  By the article establishing the Executive Department, it is made the duty   of the President "to recommend to your consideration, such measures as   he shall judge necessary and expedient." The circumstances under which   I now meet you, will acquit me from entering into that subject, farther than   to refer to the Great Constitutional Charter under which you are assembled;   and which, in defining your powers, designates the objects to which your attention   is to be given. It will be more consistent with those circumstances, and far   more congenial with the feelings which actuate me, to substitute, in place of   a recommendation of particular measures, the tribute that is due to the talents,   the rectitude, and the patriotism which adorn the characters selected to devise   and adopt them. In these honorable qualifications, I behold the surest pledges,   that as on one side, no local prejudices, or attachments; no seperate views,   nor party animosities, will misdirect the comprehensive and equal eye which   ought to watch over this great assemblage of communities and interests: so,   on another, that the foundations of our National policy will be laid in the   pure and immutable principles of private morality; and the pre-eminence of a   free Government, be exemplified by all the attributes which can win the affections   of its Citizens, and command the respect of the world.  I dwell on this prospect with every satisfaction which an ardent love for   my Country can inspire: since there is no truth more thoroughly established,   than that there exists in the oeconomy and course of nature, an indissoluble   union between virtue and happiness, between duty and advantage, between the   genuine maxims of an honest and magnanimous policy, and the solid rewards of   public prosperity and felicity: Since we ought to be no less persuaded that   the propitious smiles of Heaven, can never be expected on a nation that disregards   the eternal rules of order and right, which Heaven itself has ordained: And   since the preservation of the sacred fire of liberty, and the destiny of the   Republican model of Government, are justly considered as deeply, perhaps as   finally staked, on the experiment entrusted to the hands of the American people.  Besides the ordinary objects submitted to your care, it will remain with your   judgment to decide, how far an exercise of the occasional power delegated by   the Fifth article of the Constitution is rendered expedient at the present juncture   by the nature of objections which have been urged against the System, or by   the degree of inquietude which has given birth to them. Instead of undertaking   particular recommendations on this subject, in which I could be guided by no   lights derived from official opportunities, I shall again give way to my entire   confidence in your discernment and pursuit of the public good: For I assure   myself that whilst you carefully avoid every alteration which might endanger   the benefits of an United and effective Government, or which ought to await   the future lessons of experience; a reverence for the characteristic rights   of freemen, and a regard for the public harmony, will sufficiently influence   your deliberations on the question how far the former can be more impregnably   fortified, or the latter be safely and advantageously promoted.  To the preceeding observations I have one to add, which will be most properly   addressed to the House of Representatives. It concerns myself, and will therefore   be as brief as possible. When I was first honoured with a call into the Service   of my Country, then on the eve of an arduous struggle for its liberties, the   light in which I contemplated my duty required that I should renounce every   pecuniary compensation. From this resolution I have in no instance departed.   And being still under the impressions which produced it, I must decline as inapplicable   to myself, any share in the personal emoluments, which may be indispensably   included in a permanent provision for the Executive Department; and must accordingly   pray that the pecuniary estimates for the Station in which I am placed, may,   during my continuance in it, be limited to such actual expenditures as the public   good may be thought to require.  Having thus imparted to you my sentiments, as they have been awakened by the   occasion which brings us together, I shall take my present leave; but not without   resorting once more to the benign parent of the human race, in humble supplication   that since he has been pleased to favour the American people, with opportunities   for deliberating in perfect tranquility, and dispositions for deciding with   unparellelled unanimity on a form of Government, for the security of their Union,   and the advancement of their happiness; so his divine blessing may be equally   conspicuous in the enlarged views, the temperate consultations, and the wise   measures on which the success of this Government must depend.Whereas it is the duty of all Nations to acknowledge the providence    of Almighty God, to obey his will, to be grateful for his benefits, and humbly    to implore his protection and favor, and Whereas both Houses of Congress have    by their joint Committee requested me "to recommend to the People of    the United States a day of public thanks-giving and prayer to be observed by    acknowledging with grateful hearts the many signal favors of Almighty God, especially    by affording them an opportunity peaceably to establish a form of government    for their safety and happiness."Now therefore I do recommend and assign Thursday the 26th day of November next    to be devoted by the People of these States to the service of that great and    glorious Being, who is the beneficent Author of all the good that was, that    is, or that will be. That we may then all unite in rendering unto him our sincere    and humble thanks, for his kind care and protection of the People of this country    previous to their becoming a Nation, for the signal and manifold mercies, and    the favorable interpositions of his providence, which we experienced in the    course and conclusion of the late war, for the great degree of tranquillity,    union, and plenty, which we have since enjoyed, for the peaceable and rational    manner in which we have been enabled to establish constitutions of government    for our safety and happiness, and particularly the national One now lately instituted,    for the civil and religious liberty with which we are blessed, and the means    we have of acquiring and diffusing useful knowledge and in general for all the    great and various favors which he hath been pleased to confer upon us.And also that we may then unite in most humbly offering our prayers and supplications    to the great Lord and Ruler of Nations and beseech him to pardon our national    and other transgressions, to enable us all, whether in public or private stations,    to perform our several and relative duties properly and punctually, to render    our national government a blessing to all the People, by constantly being a    government of wise, just and constitutional laws, discreetly and faithfully    executed and obeyed, to protect and guide all Sovereigns and Nations (especially    such as have shown kindness unto us) and to bless them with good government,    peace, and concord. To promote the knowledge and practice of true religion and    virtue, and the encrease of science among them and Us, and generally to grant    unto all Mankind such a degree of temporal prosperity as he alone knows to be    best.Fellow Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives: I    embrace with great satisfaction the opportunity which now presents itself, of    congratulating you on the present favourable prospects of our public affairs.    The recent accession of the important State of North Carolina to the Constitution    of the United States (of which official information has been received); the    rising credit and respectability of our Country; the general and increasing    good will towards the Government of the Union, and the concord, peace, and plenty,    with which we are blessed are circumstances auspicious in an eminent degree,    to our national prosperity.In resuming your consultations for the general good, you cannot but derive    encouragement from the reflection that the measures of the last Session have    been as satisfactory to your Constituents, as the novelty and difficulty of    the work allowed you to hope. Still further to realize their expectations and    to secure the blessings which a Gracious Providence has placed within our reach,    will in the course of the present important Session, call for the cool and deliberate    exertion of your patriotism, firmness and wisdom.Among the many interesting objects, which will engage your attention, that    of providing for the common defence will merit particular regard. To be prepared    for War is one of the most effectual means of perserving peace.A free people ought not only to be armed but disciplined; to which end a uniform    and well digested plan is requisite: And their safety and interest require,    that they should promote such manufactories, as tend to render them independent    on others for essential, particularly for military supplies.The proper establishment of the Troops, which may be deemed indispensable,    will be entitled to mature deliberation. In the arrangements, which may be    made respecting it, it will be of importance to conciliate the comfortable support    of the Officers and Soldiers with a due regard to oeconomy.There was reason to hope that the pacific measures adopted with regard to certain    hostile tribes of Indians would have relieved the Inhabitants of our Southern    and Western frontiers from their depredations. But you will perceive from the    information contained in the papers which I shall direct to be laid before you    (comprehending a communication from the Commonwealth of Virginia) that we ought    to be prepared to afford protection to those parts of the Union; and if necessary    to punish aggressors.The interests of the United States requires that our intercourse with other    nations should be facilitated, by such provisions as will enable me to fulfill    my duty in that respect, in the manner which circumstances may render most conducive    to the public good: And to this end that the compensations to be made to the    persons who may be employed, should according to the nature of their appointments,    be defined by law; and a competent fund designated for defraying the expenses    incident to the conduct of our foreign affairs.Various considerations also render it expedient, that the terms on which foreigners    may be admitted to the rights of Citizens should be speedily ascertained by    a uniform rule of naturalization.Uniformity in the Currency, Weights and Measures of the United States is an    object of great importance, and will I am persuaded be duly attended to.The advancement of Agriculture, Commerce and Manufactures by all proper means,    will not I trust need recommendation. But I cannot forbear intimating to you    the expediency of giving effectual encouragement as well to the introduction    of new and useful inventions from abroad, as to the exertions of skill and genius    in producing them at home; and of facilitating the intercourse between the distant    parts of our Country by a due attention to the Post-Office and Post-Roads.Nor am I less persuaded, that you will agree with me in opinion, that there    is nothing which can better deserve your patronage than the promotion of Science    and Literature. Knowledge is in every country the surest basis of public happiness.    In one in which the measures of Government receive their impression so immediately    from the sense of the Community as in ours it is proportionably essential. To    the security of a free Constitution it contributes in various ways: By convincing    those who are intrusted with the public administration, that every valuable    end of Government is best answered by the enlightened confidence of the people:    and by teaching the people themselves to know and to value their own rights;    to discern and provide against invasions of them; to distinguish between oppression    and the necessary exercise of lawful authority; between burthens proceeding    from a disregard to their convenience and those resulting from the inevitable    exigencies of Society; to discriminate the spirit of Liberty from that of licentiousness,    cherishing the first, avoiding the last, and uniting a speedy, but temperate    vigilance against encroachments, with an inviolable respect to the Laws.Whether this desirable object will be the best promoted by affording aids    to seminaries of learning already established, by the institution of a national    University, or by any other expedients, will be well worthy of a place in the    deliberations of the Legislature. Fellow citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives: In   meeting you again I feel much satisfaction in being able to repeat my congratulations   on the favorable prospects which continue to distinguish our public Affairs.   The abundant fruits of another year have blessed our Country with plenty, and   with the means of a flourishing commerce. The progress of public credit is witnessed   by a considerable rise of American Stock abroad as well as at home. And the   revenues allotted for this and other national purposes, have been productive   beyond the calculations by which they were regulated. This latter circumstance   is the more pleasing as it is not only a proof of the fertility of our resources,   but as it assures us of a further increase of the national respectability and   credit; and let me add, as it bears an honorable testimony to the patriotism   and integrity of the mercantile and marine part of our Citizens. The punctuality   of the former in discharging their engagements has been exemplary.  In conforming to the powers vested in me by acts of the last Session, a loan   of three millions of florins, towards which some provisional measures had previously   taken place, has been completed in Holland. As well the celerity with which   it has been filled, as the nature of the terms, (considering the more than ordinary   demand for borrowing created by the situation of Europe) gives a reasonable   hope that the further execution of those powers may proceed with advantage and   success. The Secretary of the Treasury has my directions to communicate such   further particulars as may be requisite for more precise information.  Since your last Sessions, I have received communications by which it appears,   that the District of Kentucky, at present a part of Virginia, has concurred   in certain propositions contained in a law of that State; in consequence of   which the District is to become a distinct member of the Union, in case the   requisite sanction of Congress be added. For this sanction application is now   made. I shall cause the papers on this very important transaction to be laid   before you. The liberality and harmony, with which it has been conducted will   be found to do great honor to both the parties; and the sentiments of warm attachment   to the Union and its present Government expressed by our fellow citizens of   Kentucky cannot fail to add an affectionate concern for their particular welfare   to the great national impressions under which you will decide on the case submitted   to you.  It has been heretofore known to Congress, that frequent incursions have been   made on our frontier settlements by certain banditti of Indians from the North   West side of the Ohio. These with some of the tribes dwelling on and near the   Wabash have of late been particularly active in their depredations; and being   emboldened by the impunity of their crimes, and aided by such parts of the neighboring   tribes as could be seduced to join in their hostilities or afford them a retreat   for their prisoners and plunder, they have, instead of listening to the humane   overtures92 made on the part of the United States, renewed their violences with   fresh alacrity and greater effect. The lives of a number of valuable Citizens   have thus been sacrificed, and some of them under circumstances peculiarly shocking;   whilst others have been carried into a deplorable captivity.   These aggravated provocations rendered it essential to the safety of the Western   Settlements that the aggressors should be made sensible that the Government   of the Union is not less capable of punishing their crimes, than it is disposed   to respect their rights and reward their attachments. As this object could not   be effected by defensive measures it became necessary to put in force the Act,   which empowers the President to call out the Militia for the protection of the   frontiers. And I have accordingly authorized an expedition in which the regular   troops in that quarter are combined with such drafts of Militia as were deemed   sufficient. The event of the measure is yet unknown to me. The Secretary of   war is directed to lay before you a statement of the information on which it   is founded, as well as an estimate of the expence with which it will be attended.  The disturbed situation of Europe, and particularly the critical posture of   the great maritime powers, whilst it ought to make us more thankful for the   general peace and security enjoyed by the United States, reminds us at the same   time of the circumspection with which it becomes us to preserve these blessings.   It requires also that we should not overlook the tendency of a war and even   of preparations for a war, among the Nations most concerned in active Commerce   with this Country, to abridge the means, and thereby at least enhance the price   of transporting its valuable productions to their proper markets. I recommend   it to your serious reflexion how far and in what mode, it may be expedient to   guard against embarrassments from these contingencies, by such encouragements   to our own Navigation as will render our commerce and agriculture less dependent   on foreign bottoms, which may fail us in the very moments most interesting to   both of these great objects. Our fisheries, and the transportation of our own   produce offer us abundant means for guarding ourselves against this evil.  Your attention seems to be not less due to that particular branch of our trade   which belongs to the Mediterranean. So many circumstances unite in rendering   the present state of it distressful to us, that you will not think any deliberations   misemployed, which may lead to its relief and protection.  The laws you have already passed for the establishment of a Judiciary System   have opened the doors of Justice to all descriptions of persons. You will consider   in your wisdom, whether improvements in that system may yet be made; and particularly   whether a uniform process of execution on sentences issuing, from the federal   Courts be not desireable through all the states.  The patronage of our commerce, of our merchants and Seamen, has called for   the appointment of Consuls in foreign Countries. It seems expedient to regulate   by law the exercise of that Jurisdiction and those functions which are permitted   them, either by express Convention, or by a friendly indulgence in the places   of their residence. The Consular Convention too with his most Christian Majesty   has stipulated in certain cases, the aid of the national authority to his Consuls   established here. Some legislative provision is requisite to carry these stipulations   into full effect.  The establishment of the Militia; of a mint; of Standards of weights and measures;   of the Post Office and Post Roads are subjects which (I presume) you will resume   of course, and which are abundantly urged by their own importance.  Gentlemen of the House of Representatives: The sufficiency of the Revenues   you have established for the objects to which they are appropriated, leaves   no doubt that the residuary provisions will be commensurate to the other objects   for which the public faith stands now pledged. Allow me, moreover, to hope that   it will be a favorite policy with you not merely to secure a payment of the   Interest of the debt funded, but, as far and as fast as [the] growing resources   of the Country will permit, to exonerate it of the principal itself. The appropriation   you have made of the Western Lands explains your dispositions on this subject:   And I am persuaded the sooner that valuable fund can be made to contribute along   with other means to the actual reduction of the public debt, the more salutary   will the measure be to every public interest, as well as the more satisfactory   to our Constituents.  Gentlemen of the Senate and House of Representatives: In pursuing the various   and weighty business of the present Session I indulge the fullest persuasion   that your consultations will be equally marked with wisdom, and animated by   the love of your Country. In whatever belongs to my duty, you shall have all   the cooperation which an undiminished zeal for its welfare can inspire. It will   be happy for us both, and our best reward, if by a successful administration   of our respective trusts we can make the established Government more and more   instrumental in promoting the good of our fellow Citizens, and more and more   the object of their attachment and confidence. I the President of the United States, by my own mouth, and by   a written Speech signed with my own hand [and sealed with the Seal of the U   S] Speak to the Seneka Nation, and desire their attention, and that they would   keep this Speech in remembrance of the friendship of the United States.  I have received your Speech with satisfaction, as a proof of your confidence   in the justice of the United States, and I have attentively examined the several   objects which you have laid before me, whether delivered by your Chiefs at Tioga   point in the last month to Colonel Pickering, or laid before me in the present   month by the Cornplanter and the other Seneca Chiefs now in Philadelphia.  In the first place I observe to you, and I request it may sink deep in your   minds, that it is my desire, and the desire of the United States that all the   miseries of the late war should be forgotten and buried forever. That in future   the United States and the six Nations should be truly brothers, promoting each   other's prosperity by acts of mutual friendship and justice.  I am not uninformed that the six Nations have been led into some difficulties   with respect to the sale of their lands since the peace. But I must inform you   that these evils arose before the present government of the United States was   established, when the separate States and individuals under their authority,   undertook to treat with the Indian tribes respecting the sale of their lands.  But the case is now entirely altered. The general Government only has the   power, to treat with the Indian Nations, and any treaty formed and held without   its authority will not be binding.  Here then is the security for the remainder of your lands. No State nor person   can purchase your lands, unless at some public treaty held under the authority   of the United States. The general government will never consent to your being   defrauded. But it will protect you in all your just rights.  Hear well, and let it be heard by every person in your Nation, That the President   of the United States declares, that the general government considers itself   bound to protect you in all the lands secured you by the Treaty of Fort Stanwix,   the 22d of October 1784, excepting such parts as you may since had fairly sold   to persons properly authorized to purchase of you.  You complain that John Livingston and Oliver Phelps have obtained your lands,   assisted by Mr. Street of Niagara, and they have not complied with their agreement.  It appears upon enquiry of the Governor of New York, that John Livingston   was not legally authorized to treat with you, and that every thing he did with   you has been declared null and void, so that you may rest easy on that account.  But it does not appear from any proofs yet in the possession of government,   that Oliver Phelps has defrauded you.  If however you should have any just cause of complaint against him, and can   make satisfactory proof thereof, the federal Courts will be open to you for   redress, as to all other persons.  But your great object seems to be the security of your remaining lands, and   I have therefore upon this point, meant to be sufficiently strong and clear.  That in future you cannot be defrauded of your lands. That you possess the   right to sell, and the right of refusing to sell your lands.  That therefore the sale of your lands in future, will depend entirely upon   yourselves.  But that when you may find it for your interest to sell any parts of your   lands, the United States must be present by their Agent, and will be your security   that you shall not be defrauded in the bargain you may make.  [It will however be important, that before you make any sales of your land   that you should determine among yourselves, who are the persons among you that   shall give sure conveyances thereof as shall be binding upon your Nation and   forever preclude all disputes related to the validity of the sale.]  That besides the [before mentioned] security for your land, you will perceive   by the law of Congress, for regulating trade and intercourse with the Indian   tribes, the fatherly care the United States intend to take of the Indians. For   the particular meaning of this law, I refer you to the explanations given thereof   by Colonel Pickering at Tioga, which with the law, are herewith delivered to   you.  You have said in your Speech "That the game is going away from among   you, and that you thought it the design of the great Spirit, that you should   till the ground, but before you speak upon this subject, you want to know whether   the United States meant to leave you any land to till?"  You now know that all the lands secured to you by the Treaty of Fort Stanwix,   excepting such parts as you may since have fairly sold are yours, and that only   your own acts can convey them away; speak therefore your wishes on the subject   of tilling the ground. The United States will be happy to afford you every assistance   in the only business which will add to your numbers and happiness.  The murders that have been committed upon some of your people, by the bad   white men I sincerely lament and reprobate, and I earnestly hope that the real   murderers will be secured, and punished as they deserve. This business has been   sufficiently explained to you here, by the Governor of Pennsylvania, and by   Colonel Pickering on behalf of the United States, at Tioga.  The Senekas may be assured, that the rewards offered for apprehending the   murderers, will be continued until they are secured for trial, and that when   they shall be apprehended, that they will be tried and punished as if they had   killed white men.  Having answered the most material parts of your Speech, I shall inform you,   that some bad Indians, and the outcast of several tribes who reside at the Miamee   Village, have long continued their murders and depredations upon the frontiers,   lying along the Ohio. That they have not only refused to listen to my voice   inviting them to peace, but that upon receiving it, they renewed their incursions   and murders with greater violence than ever. I have therefore been obliged to   strike those bad people, in order to make them sensible of their madness. I   sincerely hope they will hearken to reason, and not require to be further chastised.   The United States desire to be the friends of the Indians, upon terms of justice   and humanity. But they will not suffer the depredations of the bad Indians to   go unpunished.  My desire is that you would caution all the Senekas and six Nations, to. prevent   their rash young men from joining the Miamee Indians. For the United States   cannot distinguish the tribes to which bad Indians belong, and every tribe must   take care of their own people.  The merits of the Cornplanter, and his friendship for the United States are   well known to me, and shall not be forgotten. And as a mark of the esteem of   the United States, I have directed the Secretary of war to make him a present   of Two hundred and Fifty Dollars, either in money or goods, as the Cornplanter   shall like best. And he may depend upon the future care and kindness of the   United States. And I have also directed the Secretary of War to make suitable   presents to the other Chiefs present in Philadelphia. And also that some further   tokens of friendship to be forwarded to the other Chiefs, now in their Nation.  Remember my words Senekas, continue to be strong in your friendship for the   United States, as the only rational ground of your future happiness, and you   may rely upon their kindness and protection.  An Agent shall soon be appointed to reside in some place convenient to the   Senekas and six Nations. He will represent the United States. Apply to him on   all occasions.  If any man brings you evil reports of the intentions of the United States,   mark that man as your enemy, for he will mean to deceive you and lead you into   trouble. The United States will be true and faithful to their engagements. I meet you, upon the present occasion, with the feelings which   are naturally inspired by a strong impression of the prosperous situation of   our common Country, and by a persuasion equally strong that the labours of the   present45 Session, which has just commenced, will, under the guidance of a spirit   no less prudent than patriotic, issue in measures, conducive to the stability   and increase of national prosperity.   Numerous as are the Providential blessings which demand our grateful acknowledgments;   the abundance with which another year has again rewarded the industry of the   husbandman is too important to escape recollection.  Your own observations, in your respective situations, will have satisfied   you of the progressive state of Agriculture, Manufactures, Commerce and Navigation:   In tracing their causes, you will have remarked, with particular pleasure, the   happy effects of that revival of confidence, public as well as private, to which   the Constitution and Laws of the United States have so eminently contributed:   And you will have observed, with no less interest, new and decisive proofs of   the increasing reputation and credit of the Nation. But you nevertheless, cannot   fail to derive satisfaction from the confirmation of these circumstances, which   will be disclosed, in the several official communications, that will be made   to you in the course of your deliberations.  The rapid subscriptions to the Bank of the United States, which completed   the sum allowed to be subscribed, in a single day, is among the striking and   pleasing evidences which present themselves, not only of confidence in the Government,   but of resource in the community.  In the interval of your recess due attention has been paid to the execution   of the different objects which were specially provided for by the laws and Resolutions   of the last Session.  Among the most important of these is the defence and security of the Western   Frontiers. To accomplish it on the most humane principles was a primary wish.  Accordingly, at the same time that treaties have been provisionally concluded,   and other proper means used to attach the wavering, and to confirm in their   friendship, the well-disposed tribes of Indians; effectual measures have been   adopted to make those of a hostile description sensible that a pacification   was desired upon terms of moderation and justice.  These measures having proved unsuccessful, it became necessary to convince   the refractory of the power of the United States to punish their depredations.   Offensive operations have therefore been directed; to be conducted however,   as consistently as possible with the dictates of humanity. Some of these have   been crowned with full success, and others are yet depending. The expeditions   which have been completed were carried on under the authority, and at the expense   of the United States by the Militia of Kentucke; whose enterprise, intripidity   and good conduct, are entitled to peculiar commendation.  Overtures of peace are still continued to the deluded Tribes, and considerable   numbers of individuals belonging to them, have lately renounced all further   opposition, removed from their former situations, and placed themselves under   the immediate protection of the United States.  It is sincerely to be desired that all need of coercion, in future, may cease;   and that an intimate intercourse may succeed; calculated to advance the happiness   of the Indians, and to attach them firmly to the United States.  In order to this it seems necessary: That they should experience the benefits   of an impartial administration 46 of justice. That the mode of alienating their   lands the main source of discontent and war, should be so defined and regulated,   as to obviate imposition, and, as far as may be practicable, controversy concerning   the reality, and extent of the alienations which are made. That commerce with   them should be promoted under regulations tending to secure an equitable deportment   towards them, and that such rational experiments should be made, for imparting   to them the blessings of civilization, as may, from time to time suit their   condition. That the Executive of the United States should be enabled to employ   the means to which the Indians have been long accustomed for uniting their immediate   Interests with the preservation of Peace. And that efficatious provision should   be made for inflicting adequate penalties upon all those who, by violating their   rights, shall infringe the Treaties, and endanger the peace of the Union.   A System corrisponding with the mild principles of Religion and Philanthropy   towards an unenlightened race of Men, whose happiness materially depends on   the conduct of the United States, would be as honorable to the national character   as conformable to the dictates of sound policy.  The powers specially vested in me by the Act laying certain duties on distilled   spirits, which respect the subdivisions of the districts into Surveys, the appointment   of Officers, and the assignment of compensations, have likewise been carried   into effect. In a matter in which both materials and experience were wanting   to guide the calculation, it will be readily conceived that there must have   been difficulty in such an adjustment of the rates of compensation as would   conciliate a reasonable competency with a proper regard to the limits prescribed   by the law. It is hoped that the circumspection, which has been used will be   found in the result to have secured the last of the two objects; but it is probable,   that with a view to the first, in some instances, a revision of the provision   will be found adviseable.  The impressions with which this law has been received by the community, have   been, upon the whole, such as were to be expected among enlightened and well-disposed   Citizens, from the propriety and necessity of the measure. The novelty, however   of the tax, in a considerable part of the United States, and a misconception   of some of its provisions, have given occasion, in particular places to some   degree of discontent. But it is satisfactory to know that this disposition yields   to proper explanations and more just apprehensions of the true nature of the   law. and I entertain a full confidence, that it will, in all, give way to motives   which arise out of a just sense of duty, and a virtuous regard to the public   welfare.  If there are any circumstances, in the law, which consistently with its main   design, may be so varied as to remove any well intentioned objections, that   may happen to exist, it will consist with a wise moderation to make the proper   variations. It is desirable on all occasions, to unite with a steady and firm   adherence to constitutional and necessary Acts of Government, the fullest evidence   of a disposition, as far as may be practicable, to consult the wishes of every   part of the Community, and to lay the foundations of the public administration   in the affection 47 of the people.   Pursuant to the authority contained in the several Acts on that subject, a district   of ten miles square for the permanent seat of the Government of the United States   has been fixed, and announced by proclamation; which district will comprehend   lands on both sides of the River Potomack, and the towns of Alexandria and George   Town. A City has also been laid out agreeably to a plan which will be placed   before Congress: And as there is a prospect, favoured by the rate of sales which   have already taken place, of ample funds for carrying on the necessary public   buildings, there is every expectation of their due progress.  The completion of the Census of the Inhabitants, for which provision was made   by law, has been duly notified (excepting in one instance in which the return   has been informal, and another in which it has been omitted or miscarried) and   the returns of the Officers, who were charged with this duty, which will be   laid before you, will give you the pleasing assurance that the present population   of the United States borders on four Millions of persons.  It is proper also to inform you that a further loan of two millions and a   half of Florins has been completed in Holland; the terms of which are similar   to those of the one last announced, except as to a small reduction of charges.   Another on like terms, for six Millions of Florins, had been set on foot under   circumstances that assured immediate completion.  Gentlemen of the Senate:  Two treaties, which have been provisionally concluded with the Cherokees and   Six Nations of Indians, will be laid before you for your consideration and ratification.  Gentlemen of the House of Representatives:  In entering upon the discharge of your legislative trust, you must anticipate   with pleasure, that many of the difficulties, necessarily incident to the first   arrangements of a new Government, for an extensive Country, have been happily   surmounted by the zealous, and judicious exertions of your predecessors, in   co-operation with the other branch of the legislature. The important objects,   which remain to be accomplished, will, I am persuaded, be conducted upon principles   equally comprehensive, and equally well calculated for the advancement of the   general weal.  The time limited for receiving subscriptions to the loans proposed by the   Act making provision for the debt of the United States having expired, statements   from the proper department will, as soon as possible, apprize you of the exact   result. Enough, however is already known, to afford an assurance that the views   of that Act have been substantially fulfilled. The subscription in the domestic   debt of the United States, has embraced by far the greatest proportion of that   debt; affording at the same time proof of the general satisfaction of the public   Creditors with the System which has been proposed to their acceptance, and of   the spirit of accommodation to the convenience of the Government with which   they are actuated. The subscriptions in the debts of the respective States,   as far as the provisions of the law have permitted, may be said to be yet more   general. The part of the debt of the United States, which remains unsubscribed,   will naturally engage your further deliberations.  It is particularly pleasing to me to be able to announce to you, that the   revenues which have been established, promise to be adequate to their objects;   and may be permitted, if no unforeseen exigency occurs, to supercede, for the   present, the necessity of any new burthens upon our Constituents.  An Object which will claim your early attention, is, a provision for the current   service of the ensuing year, together with such ascertained demands upon the   Treasury as require to be immediately discharged; and such casualties as may   have arisen in the execution of the public business, for which no specific appropriations   may have yet been made; of all which a proper estimate will be laid before you.  Gentlement of the Senate,   and of the House of Representatives:  I shall content myself with a general reference to former communications for   several objects, upon which the urgency of other affairs has hitherto postponed   any definite resolution. Their importance will recall them to your attention;   and I trust that the progress already made in the most arduous arrangements   of the Government, will afford you leisure to resume them with advantage.  There are, however, some of them of which I cannot forbear a more particular   mention. These are, the Militia; the Post-Office and Post-roads; the Mint; Weights   and Measures; a provision for the sale of the vacant lands of the United States.  The first is certainly an object of primary importance, whether viewed in   reference to the national security, to the satisfaction of the community, or   to the preservation of order. In connection with this, the establishment of   competent Magazines and Arsenals, and the fortification of such places as are   peculiarly important and vulnerable, naturally present themselves to consideration.   The safety of the United States, under Divine protection, ought to rest on the   basis of systematic and solid arrangements; exposed as little as possible to   the hazard of fortuitous circumstances.  The importance of the Post-Office and Post-Roads, on a plan sufficiently liberal   and comprehensive, as they respect the expedition, safety and facility of communication,   is increased by the instrumentality in diffusing a knowledge of the laws and   proceedings of the government; which, while it contributes to the security of   the people, serves also to guard them against the effects of misrepresentation   and misconception. The establishment of additional cross-posts, especially to   some of the important points in the Western and Northern parts of the Union,   cannot fail to be of material Utility.  The disorders in the existing currency, and especially the scarcity of small   change, a scarcity so peculiarly distressing to the poorer classes, strongly   recommend the carrying into immediate effect the resolution already entered   into concerning the establishment of a Mint. Measures have been taken, pursuant   to that Resolution, for procuring some of the most necessary Artists, together   with the requisite Apparatus.  An uniformity in the weights and measures of the Country is among the important   objects submitted to you by the Constitution, and if it can be derived from   a standard at once invariable and universal, must be no less honorable to the   public Councils than conducive to the public convenience.  A provision for the sale of the vacant lands of the United States is particularly   urged, among other reasons, by the important considerations that they are pledged   as a fund for reimbursing the public debt; that if timely and judiciously applied,   they may save the necessity of burthening our citizens with new taxes for the   extinguishment of the principal; and that being free to discharge the principal   but in a limited proportion no opportunity ought to be lost for availing the   public of its right. Gentlemen of the House of Representatives: I have maturely considered   the Act passed by the two Houses, intitled, "An Act for an apportionment   of Representatives among the several States according to the first enumeration,"   44 and I return it to your House, wherein it originated, with the following   objections.   First: The Constitution has prescribed that Representatives shall be apportioned   among the several States, according to their respective Numbers: and there is   no one proportion or division which, applied to the respective numbers of the   States, will yield the number and allotment of Representatives proposed by the   bill.  Second. The Constitution has also provided that the number of Representatives   shall not exceed one for every thirty thousand: which restriction is, by the   context, and by fair and obvious construction, to be applied to the seperate   and respective numbers of the States: and the bill has allotted to eight of   the States more than one for thirty thousand.  Whereas I have received authentic information, that certain lawless   and wicked persons, of the western frontier in the State of Georgia, did lately   invade, burn, and destroy a town belonging to the Cherokee nation, although   in amity with the United States, and put to death several Indians of that nation;   and whereas such outrageous conduct not only violates the rights of humanity,   but also endangers the public peace, and it highly becomes the honor and good   faith of the United States to pursue all legal means for the punishment of those   atrocious offenders; I have, therefore, thought fit to issue this my proclamation,   hereby exhorting all the citizens of the United States, and requiring all the   officers thereof, according to their respective stations, to use their utmost   endeavours to bring those offenders to justice. And I do moreover offer a reward   of five hundred dollars for each and every of the above-named persons, who shall   be so apprehended and brought to justice, and shall be proved to have assumed   or exercised any command or authority among the perpetrators of the crimes aforesaid,   at the time of committing the same. Fellow-Citizens:

I am again called upon by the voice of my Country to execute the functions of its Chief Magistrate. When the occasion proper for it shall arrive, I shall endeavour to express the high sense I entertain of this distinguished honor, and of the confidence which has been reposed in me by the people of United America.

Previous to the execution of any official act of the President, the Constitution requires an Oath of Office. This Oath I am now about to take, and in your presence, 56 that if it shall be found during my administration of the Government I have in any instance violated willingly, or knowingly, the injunction thereof, I may (besides incurring Constitutional punishmt) be subject to the upbraidings of all who are now witnesses of the present solemn Ceremony. Whereas it appears that a state of war exists between Austria,   Prussia, Sardinia, Great Britain, and the United Netherlands, on the one part,   and France on the other; and the duty and interest of the United States require,   that they should with sincerity and good faith adopt and pursue a conduct friendly   and impartial towards the belligerent powers:  I have therefore thought fit by these presents, to declare the disposition   of the United States to observe the conduct aforesaid towards those powers respectively;   and to exhort and warn the citizens of the United States carefully to avoid   all acts and proceedings whatsoever, which may in any manner tend to contravene   such disposition.  And I do hereby also make known, that whosoever of the citizens of the United   States shall render himself liable to punishment or forfeiture under the law   of nations, by committing, aiding or abetting hostilities against any of the   said powers, or by carrying to any of them, those articles which are deemed   contraband by the modern usage of nations, will not receive the protection of   the United States against such punishment or forfeiture; and further that I   have given instructions to those officers to whom it belongs, to cause prosecutions   to be instituted against all persons, who shall, within the cognizance of the   Courts of the United States, violate the law of nations, with respect to the   powers at war, or any of them.Fellow Citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives. Since the commencement of the term for which I have been again calledinto office no fit occasion has arisen for expressing to me fellow citizensat large the deep and respectful sense which I feel of the renewed testimonyof public approbation. While on the one hand it awakened my gratitude forall those instances of affectionate partiality with which I have been honoredby my country, on the other it could not prevent an earnest wish for thatretirement from which no private consideration should ever have torn me.But influenced by the belief that my conduct would be estimated accordingto its real motives, and that the people, and the authorities derived fromthem, would support exertions having nothing personal for their object,I have obeyed the suffrage which commanded me to resume the Executive power;and I humbly implore that Being on whose will the fate of nations dependsto crown with success our mutual endeavors for the general happiness. As soon as the war in Europe had embraced those powers with whom theUnited States have the most extensive relations there was reason to apprehendthat our intercourse with them might be interrupted and our dispositionfor peace drawn into question by the suspicions too often entertained bybelligerent nations. It seemed, therefore, to be my duty to admonish ourcitizens of the consequences of a contraband trade and of hostile actsto any of the parties, and to obtain by a declaration of the existing legalstate of things an easier admission of our right to the immunities belongingto our situation. Under these impressions the proclamation which will belaid before you was issued. In this posture of affairs, both new and delicate, I resolved to adoptgeneral rules which should conform to the treaties and assert the privilegesof the United States. These were reduced into a system, which will be communicatedto you. Although I have not thought of myself at liberty to forbid thesale of the prizes permitted by our treaty of commerce with France to bebrought into our ports, I have not refused to cause them to be restoredwhen they were taken within the protection of our territory, or by vesselscommissioned or equipped in a warlike form within the limits of the UnitedStates. It rests with the wisdom of Congress to correct, improve, or enforcethis plan of procedure; and it will probably be found expedient to extendthe legal code and the jurisdiction of the courts of the United Statesto many cases which, though dependent on principles already recognized,demand some further provisions. Where individuals shall, within the United States, array themselvesin hostility against any of the powers at war, or enter upon military expeditionsor enterprises within the jurisdiction of the United States, or usurp andexercise judicial authority within the United States, or where the penaltieson violations of the law of nations may have been indistinctly marked,or are inadequate -- these offenses can not receive too early and closean attention, and require prompt and decisive remedies. Whatsoever those remedies may be, they will be well administered bythe judiciary, who possess a long-established course of investigation,effectual process, and officers in the habit of executing it. In like manner, as several of the courts have doubted, under particularcircumstances, their power to liberate the vessels of a nation at peace,and even of a citizen of the United States, although seized under a falsecolor of being hostile property, and have denied their power to liberatecertain captures within the protection of our territory, it would seemproper to regulate their jurisdiction in these points. But if the Executiveis to be the resort in either of the two last-mentioned cases, it is hopedthat he will be authorized by law to have facts ascertained by the courtswhen for his own information he shall request it. I can not recommend to your notice measures for the fulfillment of ourduties to the rest of the world without again pressing upon you the necessityof placing ourselves in a condition of complete defense and of exactingfrom them the fulfillment of their duties toward us. The United Statesought not to indulge a persuasion that, contrary to the order of humanevents, they will forever keep at a distance those painful appeals to armswith which the history of every other nation abounds. There is a rank dueto the United States among nations which will be withheld, if not absolutelylost, by the reputation of weakness. If we desire to avoid insult, we mustbe able to repel it; if we desire to secure peace, one of the most powerfulinstruments of our rising prosperity, it must be known that we are at alltimes ready for war. The documents which will be presented to you willshew the amount and kinds of arms and military stores now in our magazinesand arsenals; and yet an addition even to these supplies can not with prudencebe neglected, as it would leave nothing to the uncertainty of procuringwarlike apparatus in the moment of public danger. Nor can such arrangements, with such objects, be exposed to the censureor jealousy of the warmest friends of republican government. They are incapableof abuse in the hands of the militia, who ought to possess a pride in beingthe depository of the force of the Republic, and may be trained to a degreeof energy equal to every military exigency of the United States. But itis an inquiry which can not be too solemnly pursued, whether the act "moreeffectually to provide for the national defense by establishing an uniformmilitia throughout the United States" has organized them so as to producetheir full effect; whether your own experience in the several States hasnot detected some imperfections in the scheme, and whether a material featurein an improvement of it ought not to be to afford an opportunity for thestudy of those branches of the military art which can scarcely ever beattained by practice alone. The connection of the United States with Europe has become extremelyinteresting. The occurrences which relate to it and have passed under theknowledge of the Executive will be exhibited to Congress in a subsequentcommunication. When we contemplate the war on our frontiers, it may be truly affirmedthat every reasonable effort has been made to adjust the causes of dissensionwith the Indians north of the Ohio. The instructions given to the commissionersevince a moderation and equity proceeding from a sincere love of peace,and a liberality having no restriction but the essential interests anddignity of the United States. The attempt, however, of an amicable negotiationhaving been frustrated, the troops have marched to act offensively. Althoughthe proposed treaty did not arrest the progress of military preparation,it is doubtful how far the advance of the season, before good faith justifiedactive movements, may retard them during the remainder of the year. Fromthe papers and intelligence which relate to this important subject youwill determine whether the deficiency in the number of troops granted bylaw shall be compensated by succors of militia, or additional encouragementsshall be proposed to recruits. An anxiety has been also demonstrated by the Executive for peace withthe Creeks and the Cherokees. The former have been relieved with corn andwith clothing, and offensive measures against them prohibited during therecess of Congress. To satisfy the complaints of the latter, prosecutionshave been instituted for the violences committed upon them. But the paperswhich will be delivered to you disclose the critical footing on which westand in regard to both those tribes, and it is with Congress to pronouncewhat shall be done. After they shall have provided for the present emergency, it will merittheir most serious labors to render tranquillity with the savages permanentby creating ties of interest. Next to a rigorous execution of justice onthe violators of peace, the establishment of commerce with the Indian nationsin behalf of the United States is most likely to conciliate their attachment.But it ought to be conducted without fraud, without extortion, with constantand plentiful supplies, with a ready market for the commodities of theIndians and a stated price for what they give in payment and receive inexchange. Individuals will not pursue such a traffic unless they be alluredby the hope of profit; but it will be enough for the United States to bereimbursed only. Should this recommendation accord with the opinion ofCongress, they will recollect that it can not be accomplished by any meansyet in the hands of the Executive. Gentlemen of the House of Representatives: The commissioners charged with the settlement of accounts between theUnited States and individual States concluded their important functionwithin the time limited by law, and the balances struck in their report,which will be laid before Congress, have been placed on the books of theTreasury. On the first day of June last an installment of 1,000,000 florins becamepayable on the loans of the United States in Holland. This was adjustedby a prolongation of the period of reimbursement in nature of a new loanat an interest of 5% for the term of ten years, and the expenses of thisoperation were a commission of 3%. The first installment of the loan of $2,000,000 from the Bank of theUnited States has been paid, as was directed by law. For the second itis necessary that provision be made. No pecuniary consideration is more urgent than the regular redemptionand discharge of the public debt. On none can delay be more injurious oran economy of time more valuable. The productiveness of the public revenues hitherto has continued toequal the anticipations which were formed of it, but it is not expectedto prove commensurate with all the objects which have been suggested. Someauxiliary provisions will therefore, it is presumed, be requisite, andit is hoped that these may be made consistently with a due regard to theconvenience of our citizens, who can not but be sensible of the true wisdomof encountering a small present addition to their contributions to obviatea future accumulation of burthens. But here I can not forbear to recommend a repeal of the tax on the transportationof public prints. There is no resource so firm for the Government of theUnited States as the affections of the people, guided by an enlightenedpolicy; and to this primary good nothing can conduce more than a faithfulrepresentation of public proceedings, diffused without restraint throughoutthe United States. An estimate of the appropriations necessary for the current serviceof the ensuing year and a statement of a purchase of arms and militarystores made during the recess will be presented to Congress. Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives: The several subjects to which I have now referred open a wide rangeto your deliberations and involve some of the choicest interests of ourcommon country. Permit me to bring to your remembrance the magnitude ofyour task. Without an unprejudiced coolness the welfare of the Governmentmay be hazarded; without harmony as far as consists with freedom of sentimentits dignity may be lost. But as the legislative proceedings of the UnitedStates will never, I trust, be reproached for the want of temper or ofcandor, so shall not the public happiness languish from the want of mystrenuous and warmest cooperation. 
	 Whereas, from a hope that the combinations against the Constitution   and laws of the United States, in certain of the Western counties of Pennsylvania,   would yield to time and reflection, I thought it sufficient, in the first instance,   rather to take measures for calling forth the militia than immediately to embody   them; but the moment is now come, when the overtures of forgiveness, with no   other condition than a submission to law, have been only partially accepted;   when every form of conciliation not inconsistent with the being of Government   has been adopted, without effect; when the well-disposed in those counties are   unable by their influence and example to reclaim the wicked from their fury,   and are compelled to associate in their own defence; when the proffered lenity   has been perversely misinterpreted into an apprehension that the citizens will   march with reluctance; when the opportunity of examining the serious consequences   of a treasonable opposition has been employed in propagating principles of anarchy,   endeavoring through emissaries to alienate the friends of order from its support,   and inviting enemies to perpetrate similar acts of insurrection; when it is   manifest, that violence would continue to be exercised upon every attempt to   enforce the laws; when, therefore, Government is set at defiance, the contest   being whether a small proportion of the United States shall dictate to the whole   Union, and, at the expense of those who desire peace, indulge a desperate ambition;  Now, therefore, I, George Washington, President of the United States, in obedience   to that high and irresistible duty, consigned to me by the Constitution, "to   take care that the laws be faithfully executed;" deploring that the American   name should be sullied by the outrages of citizens on their: own Government;   commiserating such as remain obstinate from delusion; but resolved, in perfect   reliance on that gracious Providence which so signally displays its goodness   towards this country, to reduce the refractory to a due subordination to the   laws; do hereby declare and make known, that, with a satisfaction which can   be equalled only by the merits of the militia summoned into service from the   States of New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Virginia, I have received   intelligence of their patriotic alacrity, in obeying the call of the present,   though painful, yet commanding necessity; that a force, which, according to   every reasonable expectation, is adequate to the exigency, is already in motion   to the scene of disaffection; that those who have confided or shall confide   in the protection of Government, shall meet full succor under the standard and   from the arms of the United States; that those who having offended against the   laws have since entitled themselves to indemnity, will be treated with the most   liberal good faith, if they shall not have forfeited their claim by any subsequent   conduct, and that instructions are given accordingly.  And I do, moreover, exhort all individuals, officers, and bodies of men, to   contemplate with abhorrence the measures leading directly or indirectly to those   crimes, which produce this resort to military coercion; to check, in their respective   spheres, the efforts of misguided or designing men to substitute their misrepresentation   in the place of truth, and their discontents in the place of stable government;   and to call to mind, that as the people of the United States have been permitted,   under the Divine favor, in perfect freedom, after solemn deliberation, in an   enlightened age, to elect their own Government, so will their gratitude for   this inestimable blessing be best distinguished by firm exertions to maintain   the Constitution and the laws.  And, lastly, I again warn all persons, whomsoever and whersoever, not to abet,   aid, or comfort the insurgents aforesaid, as they will answer the contrary at   their peril; and I do also require all officers and other citizens, according   to their several duties, as far as may be in their power, to bring under the   cognizance of the law all offenders in the premises. Fellow Citizens of the Senate and of the House of Representatives:   When we call to mind the gracious indulgence of Heaven, by which the American   People became a nation; when we survey the general prosperity of our country,   and look forward to the riches, power, and happiness, to which it seems destined;   with the deepest regret do I announce to you, that during your recess, some   of the citizens of the United States have been found capable of an insurrection.   It is due, however, to the character of our government, and to its stability,   which cannot be shaken by the enemies of order, freely to unfold the course   of this event.  During the session of the year one thousand seven hundred and ninety, it was   expedient to exercise the legislative power, granted by the constitution of   the United States, "to lay and collect excises." In a majority of   the States, scarcely an objection was heard to this mode of taxation. In some,   indeed, alarms were at first conceived, until they were banished by reason and   patriotism. In the four western counties of Pennsylvania, a prejudice, fostered   and embittered by the artifice of men, who labored for an ascendency over the   will of others, by the guidance of their passions, produced symptoms of riot   and violence. It is well known, that Congress did not hesitate to examine the   complaints which were presented, and to relieve them, as far as justice dictated,   or general convenience would permit, But the impression, which this moderation   made on the discontented, did not correspond, with what it deserved. The arts   of delusion were no longer confined to the efforts of designing individuals.  The very forbearance to press prosecutions was misinterpreted into a fear   of urging the execution of the laws; and associations of men began to denounce   threats against the officers employed. From a belief, that by a more formal   concert, their operation might be defeated, certain self-created societies 36   assumed the tone of condemnation. Hence, while the greater part of Pennsylvania   itself were conforming themselves to the acts of excise, a few counties were   resolved to frustrate them. It was now perceived, that every expectation from   the tenderness which had been hitherto pursued, was unavailing, and that further   delay could only create an opinion of impotency or irresolution in the government.   Legal process was, therefore, delivered to the marshal, against the rioters   and delinquent distillers.   No sooner was he understood to be engaged in this duty, than the vengeance of   armed men was aimed at his person, and the person and property of the inspector   of the revenue. They fired upon the marshal, arrested him, and detained him   for some time, as a prisoner. He was obliged, by the jeopardy of his life, to   renounce the service of other process, on the west side of the Allegeny mountain;   and a deputation was afterwards sent to him to demand a surrender of that which   he had served. A numerous body repeatedly attacked the house of the inspector,   seized his papers of office, and finally destroyed by fire, his buildings, and   whatsoever they contained. Both of these officers, from a just regard to their   safety, fled to the seat of government; it being avowed, that the motives to   such outrages were to compel the resignation of the inspector, to withstand   by force of arms the authority of the United States, and thereby to extort a   repeal of the laws of excise, and an alteration in the conduct of government.  Upon the testimony of these facts, an associate Justice of the Supreme Court   of the United States notified to me, that "in the counties of Washington   and Allegeny, in Pennsylvania, laws of the United States were opposed, and the   execution thereof obstructed by combinations, too powerful to be suppressed   by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings, or by the powers vested in the   marshal of that district." On this call, momentous in the extreme, I sought   and weighed, what might best subdue the crisis. On the one hand, the judiciary   was pronounced to be stripped of its capacity to enforce the laws; crimes, which   reached the very existence of social order, were perpetrated without controul,   the friends of government were insulted, abused, and overawed into silence,   or an apparent acquiescence; and the yield to the treasonable fury of so small   a portion of the United States, would be to violate the fundamental principle   of our constitution, which enjoins that the will of the majority shall prevail.   On the other, to array citizen against citizen, to publish the dishonor of such   excesses, to encounter the expense, and other embarrassments of so distant an   expedition, were steps too delicate, too closely interwoven with many affecting   considerations, to be lightly adopted. I postponed, therefore, the summoning   of the militia immediately into the field. But I required them to be held in   readiness, that if my anxious endeavours to reclaim the deluded, and to convince   the malignant of their danger, should be fruitless, military force might be   prepared to act, before the season should be too far advanced.  My Proclamation of the 7th of August last was accordingly issued, and accompanied   by the appointment of Commissioners, who were charged to repair to the scene   of insurrection. They were authorized to confer with any bodies of men, or individuals.   They were instructed to be candid and explicit, in stating the sensations, which   had been excited in the Executive, and his earnest wish to avoid a resort to   coercion. To represent, however, that without submission, coercion must be the   resort; but to invite them, at the same time, to return to the demeanor of faithful   citizens, by such accommodations as lay within the sphere of the executive power.   Pardon, too, was tendered to them by the government of the United States, and   that of Pennsylvania, upon no other condition, than a satisfactory assurance   of obedience to the laws.  Although the report of the commissioners marks their firmness and abilities,   and must unite all virtuous men, by shewing, that the means of conciliation   have been exhausted, all of those who had committed or abetted the tumults,   did not subscribe the mild form, which was proposed, as the atonement; and the   indications of a peaceable temper were neither sufficiently general, nor conclusive,   to recommend or warrant, a further suspension of the march of the militia.  Thus, the painful alternative could not be discarded. I ordered the militia   to march, after once more admonishing the insurgents, in my proclamation of   the 25th of September last.  It was a task too difficult to ascertain with precision, the lowest degree   of force, competent to the quelling of the insurrection. From a respect, indeed,   to oeconomy, and the ease of my fellow citizens belonging to the militia, it   would have gratified me to accomplish such an estimate. My very reluctance to   ascribe too much importance to the opposition, had its extent been accurately   seen, would have been a decided inducement to the smallest efficient numbers.   In this uncertainty, therefore, I put in motion fifteen thousand men, as being   an army, which, according to all human calculation, would be prompt, and adequate   in every view; and might perhaps, by rendering resistance desperate, prevent   the effusion of blood. Quotas had been assigned to the states of New-Jersey,   Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Virginia; the governor of Pennsylvania having declared   on this occasion, an opinion which justified a requisition to the other states.  As commander in chief of the militia, when called into the actual service   of the United States, I have visited the places of general rendezvous, to obtain   more exact information, and to direct a plan for ulterior movements. Had there   been room for a persuasion, that the laws were secure from obstruction; that   the civil magistrate was able to bring to justice such of the most culpable,   as have not embraced the proffered terms of amnesty, and may be deemed fit objects   of example; that the friends to peace and good government were not in need of   that aid and countenance, which they ought always to receive, and I trust, ever   will receive, against the vicious and turbulent; I should have caught with avidity   the opportunity of restoring the militia to their families and home. But succeeding   intelligence has tended to manifest the necessity of what has been done; it   being now confessed by those who were not inclined to exaggerate the ill-conduct   of the insurgents, that their malevolence was not pointed merely to a particular   law; but that a spirit, inimical to all order, has actuated many of the offenders.   If the state of things had afforded reason for the continuance of my presence   with the army, it would not have been withholden. But every appearance assuring   such an issue, as will redound to the reputation and strength of the United   States, I have judged it most proper, to resume my duties at the seat of government,   leaving the chief command with the governor of Virginia.  Still, however, as it is probable, that in a commotion like the present, whatsoever   may be the pretence, the purposes of mischief and revenge may not be laid aside;   the stationing of a small force for a certain period in the four western counties   of Pennsylvania will be indispensable; whether we contemplate the situation   of those, who are connected with the execution of the laws; or of others who   may have exposed themselves by an honorable attachment to them.  Thirty days from the commencement of this session, being the legal limitation   of the employment of the militia, Congress cannot be too early occupied with   this subject.  Among the discussions, which may arise from this aspect of our affairs, and   from the documents which will be submitted to Congress, it will not escape their   observation, that not only the inspector of the revenue, but other officers   of the United States in Pennsylvania have, from their fidelity in the discharge   of their functions, sustained material injuries to their property. The obligation   and policy of indemnifying them are strong and obvious. It may also merit attention,   whether policy will not enlarge this provision to the retribution of other citizens,   who, though not under the ties of office, may have suffered damage by their   generous exertions for upholding the constitution and the laws. The amount,   even if all the injured were included, would not be great; and on future emergencies,   the government would be amply repaid by the influence of an example, that he,   who incurs a loss in its defence shall find a recompense in its liberality.  While there is cause to lament, that occurrences of this nature should have   disgraced the name, or interrupted the tranquillity of any part of our community,   or should have diverted to a new application, any portion of the public resources,   there are not wanting real and substantial consolations for the misfortune.   It has demonstrated, that our prosperity rests on solid foundations; by furnishing   an additional proof, that my fellow citizens understand the true principles   of government and liberty: that they feel their inseparable union: that notwithstanding   all the devices which have been used to sway them from their interest and duty,   they are now as ready to maintain the authority of the laws against licentious   invasions, as they were to defend their rights against usurpation. It has been   a spectacle, displaying to the highest advantage, the value of Republican Government,   to behold the most and least wealthy of our citizens standing in the same ranks   as private soldiers; pre-eminently distinguished by being the army of the constitution;   undeterred by a march of three hundred miles over rugged mountains, by the approach   of an inclement season, or by any other discouragement. Nor ought I to omit   to acknowledge the efficacious and patriotic co-operation, which I have experienced   from the chief magistrates of the states, to which my requisitions have been   addressed.  To every description, indeed, of citizens let praise be given. But let them   persevere in their affectionate vigilance over that precious depository of American   happiness, the constitution of the United States. Let them cherish it too, for   the sake of those, who from every clime are daily seeking a dwelling in our   land. And when in the calm moments of reflection, they shall have retraced the   origin and progress of the insurrection, let them determine, whether it has   not been fomented by combinations of men, who, careless of consequences, and   disregarding the unerring truth, that those who rouse, cannot always appease   a civil convulsion, have disseminated, from an ignorance or version of facts,   suspicions, jealousies, and accusations of the whole government.  Having thus fulfilled the engagement, which I took, when I entered into office,   "to the best of my ability to preserve, protect, and defend the constitution   of the United States," on you, Gentlemen, and the people by whom you are   deputed, I rely for support.  In the arrangements, to which the possibility of a similar contingency will   naturally draw your attention, it ought not to be forgotten, that the militia   laws have exhibited such striking defects, as could not have been supplied but   by the zeal of our citizens. Besides the extraordinary expense and waste, which   are not the least of the defects, every appeal to those laws is attended with   a doubt of its success.  The devising and establishing of a well regulated militia, would be a genuine   source of legislative honor, and a perfect title to public gratitude. I, therefore,   entertain a hope, that the present session will not pass, without carrying to   its full energy the power of organizing, arming, and disciplining the militia;   and thus providing, in the language of the constitution, for calling them forth   to execute the laws of the union, suppress insurrections, and repel invasions.  As auxiliary to the state of our defence, to which Congress can never too   frequently recur, they will not omit to enquire whether the fortifications,   which have been already licensed by law, be commensurate with our exigencies.  The intelligence from the army, under the command of general Wayne, is a happy   presage to our military operations against the hostile Indians north of the   Ohio. From the advices which have been forwarded, the advance which he has made   must have damped the ardor of the savages, and weakened their obstinacy in waging   war against the United States. And yet, even at this late hour, when our power   to punish them cannot be questioned, we shall not be unwilling to cement a lasting   peace, upon terms of candor, equity, and good neighborhood.  Towards none of the Indian tribes have overtures of friendship been spared.   The Creeks in particular are covered from encroachment by the interposition   of the General Government and that of Georgia. From a desire also to remove   the discontents of the Six Nations, a settlement, meditated at Presqu'isle on   Lake Erie, has been suspended; and an agent is now endeavoring to rectify any   misconception, into which they may have fallen. But I cannot refrain from again   pressing upon your deliberations, the plan which I recommended at the last session,   for the improvement of harmony with all the Indians within our limits, by the   fixing and conducting of trading houses, upon the principles then expressed.  Gentlemen of the House of Representatives: The time, which has elapsed, since   the commencement of our fiscal measures, has developed our pecuniary resources,   so as to open a way for a definitive plan for the redemption of the public debt.   It is believed, that the result is such, as to encourage Congress to consummate   this work, without delay. Nothing can more promote the permanent welfare of   the nation, and nothing would be more grateful to our constituents. Indeed whatsoever   is unfinished of our system of public credit, cannot be benefited by procrastination;   and as far as may be practicable, we ought to place that credit on grounds which   cannot be disturbed, and to prevent that progressive accumulation of debt which   must ultimately endanger all governments.  An estimate of the necessary appropriations, including the expenditures into   which we have been driven by the insurrection, will be submitted to Congress.  Gentlemen of the Senate, and of the House of Representatives: The mint of   the United States has entered upon the coinage of the precious metals; and considerable   sums of defective coins and bullion have been lodged with the director by individuals.   There is a pleasing prospect that the institution will, at no remote day, realize   the expectation which was originally formed of its utility.  In subsequent communications, certain circumstances of our intercourse with   foreign nations, will be transmitted to Congress. However, it may not be unseasonable   to announce that my policy in our foreign transactions has been, to cultivate   peace with all the world; to observe treaties with pure and absolute faith;   to check every deviation from the line of impartiality; to explain what may   have been misapprehended, and correct what may have been injurious to any nation;   and having thus acquired the right, to lose no time in acquiring the ability,   to insist upon justice being done to ourselves.  Let us unite, therefore, in imploring the Supreme Ruler of nations, to spread   his holy protection over these United States: to turn the machinations of the   wicked to the confirming of our constitution: to enable us at all times to root   out internal sedition, and put invasion to flight: to perpetuate to our country   that prosperity, which his goodness has already conferred, and to verify the   anticipations of this government being a safe guard to human rights. Whereas the commissioners appointed by the President of the United   States to confer with the citizens in the western counties of Pennsylvania during   the late insurrection which prevailed therein, by their act and agreement bearing   date the 2d day of September last, in pursuance of the powers in them vested,   did promise and engage that if assurances of submission to the laws of the United   States should be bona fide given by the citizens resident in the fourth survey   of Pennsylvania, in the manner and within the time in the said act and agreement   specified, a general pardon should be granted on the 10th day of July then next   ensuing of all treasons and other indictable offenses against the United States   committed within the said survey before the 22d day of August last, excluding   therefrom, nevertheless, every person who should refuse or neglect to subscribe   such assurance and engagement in manner aforesaid, or who should after such   subscription violate the same, or will fully obstruct or attempt to obstruct   the execution of the acts for raising a revenue on distilled spirits and stills,   or be aiding or abetting therein; and  Whereas I have since thought proper to extend' the said pardon to all persons   guilty of the said treasons, misprisions of treasons, or otherwise concerned   in the late insurrection within the survey aforesaid who have not since been   indicted or convicted thereof, or of any other offense against the United States:  Therefore be it known that I, George Washington, President of the said United   States, have granted, and by these presents do grant, a full, free, and entire   pardon to all persons (excepting as is hereinafter excepted) of all treasons,   misprisions of treason, and other indictable offenses against the United States   committed within the fourth survey of Pennsylvania before the said 22d day of   August last past, excepting and excluding therefrom, nevertheless, every person   who refused or neglected to give and subscribe the said assurances in the manner   aforesaid (or having subscribed hath violated the same) and now standeth indicted   or convicted of any treason, misprision of treason, or other offense against   the said United States, hereby remitting and releasing unto all persons, except   as before excepted, all penalties incurred, or supposed to be incurred, for   or on account of the premises. Gentlemen of the House of Representatives: With the utmost attention     I have considered your resolution of the 24th. instant, requesting me to lay     before your House, a copy of the instructions to the Minister of the United     States who negotiated the Treaty with the King of Great Britain, together with     the correspondence and other documents relative to that Treaty, excepting such     of the said papers as any existing negotiation may render improper to be disclosed.  In deliberating upon this subject, it was impossible for me to lose sight   of the principle which some have avowed in its discussion; or to avoid extending   my views to the consequences which must flow from the admission of that principle.  I trust that no part of my conduct has ever indicated a disposition to withhold   any information which the Constitution has enjoined upon the President as a   duty to give, or which could be required of him by either House of Congress   as a right; And with truth I affirm, that it has been, as it will continue to   be, while I have the honor to preside in the Government, my constant endeavour   to harmonize with the other branches thereof; so far as the trust delegated   to me by the People of the United States, and my sense of the obligation it   imposes to "preserve, protect and defend the Constitution" will permit.  The nature of foreign negotiations requires caution; and their success must   often depend on secrecy: and even when brought to a conclusion, a full disclosure   of all the measures, demands, or eventual concessions, which may have been proposed   or contemplated, would be extremely impolitic: for this might have a pernicious   influence on future negotiations; or produce immediate inconveniences, perhaps   danger and mischief, in relation to other powers. The necessity of such caution   and secrecy was one cogent reason for vesting the power of making Treaties in   the President, with the advice and consent of the Senate, the principle on which   that body was formed confining it to a small number of Members.  To admit then a right in the House of Representatives to demand, and to have   as a matter of course, all the Papers respecting a negotiation with a foreign   power, would be to establish a dangerous precedent.  It does not occur that the inspection of the papers asked for, be relative   to any purpose under the cognizance of the House of Representatives, except   that of an impeachment, which the resolution has not expressed. I repeat, that   I have no disposition to withhold any information which the duty of my station   will permit, or the public good shall require to be disclosed: and in fact,   all the Papers affecting the negotiation with Great Britain were laid before   the Senate, when the Treaty itself was communicated for their consideration   and advice.  The course which the debate has taken, on the resolution of the House, leads   to some observations on the mode of making treaties under the Constitution of   the United States.  Having been a member of the General Convention, and knowing the principles   on which the Constitution was formed, I have ever entertained but one opinion   on this subject; and from the first establishment of the Government to this   moment, my conduct has exemplified that opinion, that the power of making treaties   is exclusively vested in the President, by and with the advice and consent of   the Senate, provided two thirds of the Senators present concur, and that every   treaty so made, and promulgated, thenceforward became the Law of the land. It   is thus that the treaty making power has been understood by foreign Nations:   and in all the treaties made with them, we have declared, and they have believed,   that when ratified by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate,   they became obligatory. In this construction of the Constitution every House   of Representatives has heretofore acquiesced; and until the present time, not   a doubt or suspicion has appeared to my knowledge that this construction was   not the true one. Nay, they have more than acquiesced: for till now, without   controverting the obligation of such treaties, they have made all the requisite   provisions for carrying them into effect.  There is also reason to believe that this construction agrees with the opinions   entertained by the State Conventions, when they were deliberating on the Constitution;   especially by those who objected to it, because there was not required, in commercial   treaties, the consent of two thirds of the whole number of the members of the   Senate, instead of two thirds of the Senators present; and because in treaties   respecting territorial and certain other rights and claims, the concurrence   of three fourths of the whole number of the members of both houses respectively,   was not made necessary.  It is a fact declared by the General Convention, and universally understood,   that the Constitution of the United States was the result of a spirit of amity   and mutual concession. And it is well known that under this influence the smaller   States were admitted to an equal representation in the Senate with the larger   States; and that this branch of the government was invested with great powers:   for on the equal participation of those powers, the sovereignty andpolitical   safety of the smaller States were deemed essentially to depend.  If other proofs than these, and the plain letter of the Constitution itself,   be necessary to ascertain the point under consideration, they may be found in   the journals of the General Convention, which I have deposited in the office   of the department of State. In these journals it will appear that a proposition   was made, "that no Treaty should be binding on the United States which   was not ratified by a Law"; and that the proposition was explicitly rejected.  As therefore it is perfectly clear to my understanding, that file assent of   the House of Representatives is not necessary to the validity of a treaty: as   the treaty with Great Britain exhibits in itself all the objects requiring legislative   provision; And on these the papers called for can throw no light: And as it   is essential to the due administration of the government, that the boundaries   fixed by the constitution between the different departments should be preserved:   A just regard to the Constitution and to the duty of my Office, under all the   circumstances of this case, forbids a complyance with your request.The period for a new election of a citizen to administer the Executive Government of the United States being not far distant, and the time actually arrived when your thoughts must be employed in designating the person who is to be clothed with that important trust, it appears to me proper, especially as it may conduce to a more distinct expression of the public voice, that I should now apprise you of the resolution I have formed to decline being considered among the number of those out of whom a choice is to be made.

I beg you at the same time to do me the justice to be assured that this resolution has not been taken without a strict regard to all the considerations appertaining to the relation which binds a dutiful citizen to his country; and that in withdrawing the tender of service, which silence in my Situation might imply, I am influenced by no diminution of zeal for your future interest, no deficiency of grateful respect for your past kindness, but am supported by a full conviction that the step is compatible with both.

The acceptance of and continuance hitherto in the office to which your suffrages have twice called me have been a uniform sacrifice of inclination to the opinion of duty and to a deference for what appeared to be your desire. I constantly hoped that it would have been much earlier in my power, consistently with motives which I was not at liberty to disregard, to return to that retirement from which I had been reluctantly drawn. The strength of my inclination to do this previous to the last election had even led to the preparation of an address to declare it to you; but mature reflection on the then perplexed and critical posture of our affairs with foreign nations and the unanimous advice of persons entitled to my confidence impelled me to abandon the idea. I rejoice that the state of your concerns, external as well as internal, no longer renders the pursuit of inclination incompatible with the sentiment of duty or propriety, and am persuaded, whatever partiality may be retained for my services, that in the present circumstances of our country you will not disapprove my determination to retire.

The impressions with which I first undertook the arduous trust were explained on the proper occasion. In the discharge of this trust I will only say that I have, with good intentions, contributed toward the organization and administration of the Government the best exertions of which a very fallible judgment was capable, Not unconscious in the outset of the inferiority of my qualifications, experience in my own eyes, perhaps still more in the eyes of others, has strengthened the motives to diffidence of myself; and every day the increasing weight of years admonishes me more and more that the shade of retirement is as necessary to me as it will be welcome. Satisfied that if any circumstances have given peculiar value to my services they were temporary, I have the consolation to believe that, while choice and prudence invite me to quit the political scene, patriotism does not forbid it.

In looking forward to the moment which is intended to terminate the career of my political life my feelings do not permit me to suspend the deep acknowledgment of that debt of gratitude which I owe to my beloved country for the many honors it has conferred upon me; still more for the steadfast confidence with which it has supported me, and for the opportunities I have thence enjoyed of manifesting my inviolable attachment by services faithful and persevering, though in usefulness unequal to my zeal. If benefits have resulted to our country from these services, let it always be remembered to your praise and as an instructive example in our annals that under circumstances in which the passions, agitated in every direction, were liable to mislead; amidst appearances sometimes dubious; vicissitudes of fortune often discouraging; in situations in which not unfrequently want of success has countenanced the spirit of criticism, the constancy of your support was the essential prop of the efforts and a guaranty of the plans by which they were effected. Profoundly penetrated with this idea, I shall carry it with me to my grave as a strong incitement to unceasing vows that Heaven may continue to you the choicest tokens of its beneficence; that your union and brotherly affection may be perpetual; that the free Constitution which is the work of your hands may be sacredly maintained; that its administration in every department may be stamped with wisdom and virtue; that, in fine, the happiness of the people of these States, under the auspices of liberty, may be made complete by so careful a preservation and so prudent a use of this blessing as will acquire to them the glory of recommending it to the applause, the affection, and adoption of every nation which is yet a stranger to it.

Here, perhaps, I ought to stop. But a solicitude for your welfare which can not end but with my life, and the apprehension of danger natural to that solicitude, urge me on an occasion like the present to offer to your solemn contemplation and to recommend to your frequent review some sentiments which are the result of much reflection, of no inconsiderable observation, and which appear to me all important to the permanency of your felicity as a people. These will be offered to you with the more freedom as you can only see in them the disinterested warnings of a parting friend, who can possibly have no personal motive to bias his counsel. Nor can I forget as an encouragement to it your indulgent reception of my sentiments on a former and not dissimilar occasion.

Interwoven as is the love of liberty with every ligament of your hearts, no recommendation of mine is necessary to fortify or confirm the attachment.

The unity of government which constitutes you one people is also now dear to you. It is justly so, for it is a main pillar in the edifice of your real independence, the support of your tranquillity at home, your peace abroad, of your safety, of your prosperity, of that very liberty which you so highly prize. But as it is easy to foresee that from different causes and from different quarters much pains will be taken, many artifices employed, to weaken in your minds the conviction of this truth, as this is the point in your political fortress against which the batteries of internal and external enemies will be most constantly and actively (though often covertly and insidiously) directed, it is of infinite moment that you should properly estimate the immense value of your national union to your collective and individual happiness; that you should cherish a cordial, habitual, and immovable attachment to it; accustoming yourselves to think and speak of it as of the palladium of your political safety and prosperity; watching for its preservation with jealous anxiety; discountenancing whatever may suggest even a suspicion that it can in any event be abandoned, and indignantly frowning upon the first dawning of every attempt to alienate any portion of our country from the rest or to enfeeble the sacred ties which now link together the various parts.

For this you have every inducement of sympathy and interest. Citizens by birth or choice of a common country, that country has a right to concentrate your affections. The name of American, which belongs to you in your national capacity, must always exalt the just pride of patriotism more than any appellation derived from local discriminations. With slight shades of difference, you have the same religion, manners, habits, and political principles. You have in a common cause fought and triumphed together. The independence and liberty you possess are the work of joint councils and joint efforts, of common dangers, sufferings, and successes.

But these considerations, however powerfully they address themselves to your sensibility, are greatly outweighed by those which apply more immediately to your interest. Here every portion of our country finds the most commanding motives for carefully guarding and preserving the union of the whole.

The North, in an unrestrained intercourse with the South, protected by the equal laws of a common government, finds in the productions of the latter great additional resources of maritime and commercial enterprise and precious materials of manufacturing industry. The South, in the same intercourse, benefiting by the same agency of the North, sees its agriculture grow and its commerce expand. Turning partly into its own channels the seamen of the North, it finds its particular navigation invigorated; and while it contributes in different ways to nourish and increase the general mass of the national navigation, it looks forward to the protection of a maritime strength to which itself is unequally adapted. The East, in a like intercourse with the West, already finds, and in the progressive improvement of interior communications by land and water will more and more find, a valuable vent for the commodities which it brings from abroad or manufactures at home. The West derives from the East supplies requisite to its growth and comfort, and what is perhaps of still greater consequence, it must of necessity owe the secure enjoyment of indispensable outlets for its own productions to the weight, influence, and the future maritime strength of the Atlantic side of the Union, directed by an indissoluble community of interest as one nation. Any other tenure by which the West can hold this essential advantage, whether derived from its own separate strength or from an apostate and unnatural connection with any foreign power, must be intrinsically precarious.

While, then, every part of our country thus feels an immediate and particular interest in union, all the parts combined can not fail to find in the united mass of means and efforts greater strength, greater resource, proportionably greater security from external danger, a less frequent interruption of their peace by foreign nations, and what is of inestimable value, they must derive from union an exemption from those broils and wars between themselves which so frequently afflict neighboring countries not tied together by the same governments, which their own rivalships alone would be sufficient to produce, but which opposite foreign alliances, attachments, and intrigues would stimulate and imbitter. Hence, likewise, they will avoid the necessity of those overgrown military establishments which, under any form of government, are inauspicious to liberty, and which are to be regarded as particularly hostile to republican liberty. In this sense it is that your union ought to be considered as a main prop of your liberty, and that the love of the one ought to endear to you the preservation of the other.

These considerations speak a persuasive language to every reflecting and virtuous mind, and exhibit the continuance of the union as a primary object of patriotic desire. Is there a doubt whether a common government can embrace so large a sphere? Let experience solve it. To listen to mere speculation in such a case were criminal. We are authorized to hope that a proper organization of the whole, with the auxiliary agency of governments for the respective subdivisions, will afford a happy issue to the experiment. It is well worth a fair and full experiment. With such powerful and obvious motives to union affecting all parts of our country, while experience shall not have demonstrated its impracticability, there will always be reason to distrust the patriotism of those who in any quarter may endeavor to weaken its bands.

In contemplating the causes which may disturb our union it occurs as matter of serious concern that any ground should have been furnished for characterizing parties by geographical discriminations--Northern and Southern, Atlantic and Western-- whence designing men may endeavor to excite a belief that there is a real difference of local interests and views. One of the expedients of party to acquire influence within particular districts is to misrepresent the opinions and aims of other districts. You can not shield yourselves too much against the jealousies and heartburnings which spring from these misrepresentations; they tend to render alien to each other those who ought to be bound together by fraternal affection. The inhabitants of our Western country have lately had a useful lesson on this head. They have seen in the negotiation by the Executive and in the unanimous ratification by the Senate of the treaty with Spain, and in the universal satisfaction at that event throughout the United States, a decisive proof how unfounded were the suspicions propagated among them of a policy in the General Government and in the Atlantic States unfriendly to their interests in regard to the Mississippi. They have been witnesses to the formation of two treaties that with Great Britain and that with Spain--which secure to them everything they could desire in respect to our foreign relations toward confirming their prosperity. Will it not be their wisdom to rely for the preservation of these advantages on the union by which they were procured? Will they not henceforth be deaf to those advisers, if such there are, who would sever them from their brethren and connect them with aliens?

To the efficacy and permanency of your union a government for the whole is indispensable. No alliances, however strict, between the parts can be an adequate substitute. They must inevitably experience the infractions and interruptions which all alliances in all times have experienced. Sensible of this momentous truth, you have improved upon your first essay by the adoption of a Constitution of Government better calculated than your former for an intimate union and for the efficacious management of your common concerns. This Government, the offspring of our own choice, uninfluenced and unawed, adopted upon full investigation and mature deliberation, completely free in its principles, in the distribution of its powers, uniting security with energy, and containing within itself a provision for its own amendment, has a just claim to your confidence and your support. Respect for its authority, compliance with its laws, acquiescence in its measures, are duties enjoined by the fundamental maxims of true liberty. The basis of our political systems is the right of the people to make and to alter their constitutions of government. But the constitution which at any time exists till changed by an explicit and authentic act of the whole people is sacredly obligatory upon all. The very idea of the power and the right of the people to establish government presupposes the duty of every individual to obey the established government.

All obstructions to the execution of the laws, all combinations and associations, under whatever plausible character, with the real design to direct, control, counteract, or awe the regular deliberation and action of the constituted authorities, are destructive of this fundamental principle and of fatal tendency. They serve to organize faction; to give it an artificial and extraordinary force; to put in the place of the delegated will of the nation the will of a party, often a small but artful and enterprising minority of the community, and, according to the alternate triumphs of different parties, to snake the public administration the mirror of the ill-concerted and incongruous projects of faction rather than the organ of consistent and wholesome plans, digested by common counsels and modified by mutual interests.

However combinations or associations of the above description may now and then answer popular ends, they are likely in the course of time and things to become potent engines by which cunning, ambitious, and unprincipled men will be enabled to subvert the power of the people, and to usurp for themselves the reins of government, destroying. afterwards the very engines which have lifted them to unjust dominion.

Toward the preservation of your Government and the permanency of your present happy state, it is requisite not only that you steadily discountenance irregular oppositions to its acknowledged authority, but also that you resist with care the spirit of innovation upon its principles, however specious the pretexts. One method of assault may be to effect in the forms of the Constitution alterations which will impair the energy of the system, and thus to undermine what can not be directly overthrown. In all the changes to which you may be invited remember that time and habit are at least as necessary to fix the true character of governments as of other human institutions; that experience is the surest standard by which to test the real tendency of the existing constitution of a country; that facility in changes upon the credit of mere hypothesis and opinion exposes to perpetual change, from the endless variety of hypothesis and opinion; and remember especially that for the efficient management of your common interests in a country so extensive as ours a government of as much vigor as is consistent with the perfect security of liberty is indispensable. Liberty itself will find in such a government, with powers properly distributed and adjusted, its surest guardian. It is, indeed, little else than a name where the government is too feeble to withstand the enterprises of faction, to confine each member of the society within the limits prescribed by the laws, and to maintain all in the secure and tranquil enjoyment of the rights of person and property.

I have already intimated to you the danger of parties in the State, with particular reference to the founding of them on geographical discriminations. Let me now take a more comprehensive view, and warn you in the most solemn manner against the baneful effects of the spirit of party generally.

This spirit, unfortunately, is inseparable from our nature, having its root in the strongest passions of the human mind. It exists under different shapes in all governments, more or less stifled, controlled, or repressed; but in those of the popular form it is seen in its greatest rankness and is truly their worst enemy.

The alternate domination of one faction over another, sharpened by the spirit of revenge natural to party dissension, which in different ages and countries has perpetrated the most horrid enormities, is itself a frightful despotism. But this leads at length to a more formal and permanent despotism. The disorders and miseries which result gradually incline the minds of men to seek security and repose in the absolute power of an individual, and sooner or later the chief of some prevailing faction, more able or more fortunate than his competitors, turns this disposition to the purposes of his own elevation on the ruins of public liberty.

Without looking forward to an extremity of this kind (which nevertheless ought not to be entirely out of sight), the common and continual mischiefs of the spirit of party are sufficient to make it the interest and duty of a wise people to discourage and restrain it.

It serves always to distract the public councils and enfeeble the public administration. It agitates the community with ill-rounded jealousies and false alarms; kindles the animosity of one part against another; foments occasionally riot and insurrection. It opens the door to foreign influence and corruption, which find a facilitated access to the government itself through the channels of party passion. Thus the policy and the will of one country are subjected to the policy and will of another.

There is an opinion that parties in free countries are useful checks upon the administration of the government, and serve to keep alive the spirit of liberty. This within certain limits is probably true; and in governments of a monarchical cast patriotism may look with indulgence, if not with favor, upon the spirit of party. But in those of the popular character, in governments purely elective, it is a spirit not to be encouraged. From their natural tendency it is certain there will always be enough of that spirit for every salutary purpose; and there being constant danger of excess, the effort ought to be by force of public opinion to mitigate and assuage it. A fire not to be quenched, it demands a uniform vigilance to prevent its bursting into a flame, lest, instead of warming, it should consume.

It is important, likewise, that the habits of thinking in a free country should inspire caution in those intrusted with its administration to confine themselves within their respective constitutional spheres, avoiding in the exercise of the powers of one department to encroach upon another. The spirit of encroachment tends to consolidate the powers of all the departments in one, and thus to create, whatever the form of government, a real despotism. A just estimate of that love of power and proneness to abuse it which predominates in the human heart is sufficient to satisfy us of the truth of this position. The necessity of reciprocal checks in the exercise of political power, by dividing and distributing it into different depositories, and constituting each the guardian of the public weal against invasions by the others, has been evinced by experiments ancient and modern, some of them in our country and under our own eyes. To preserve them must be as necessary as to institute them. If in the opinion of the people the distribution or modification of the constitutional powers be in any particular wrong, let it be corrected by an amendment in the way which the Constitution designates. But let there be no change by usurpation; for though this in one instance may be the instrument of good, it is the customary weapon by which free governments are destroyed. The precedent must always greatly overbalance in permanent evil any partial or transient benefit which the use can at any time yield.

Of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political prosperity, religion and morality are indispensable supports. In vain would that man claim the tribute of patriotism who should labor to subvert these great pillars of human happiness--these firmest props of the duties of men and citizens. The mere politician, equally with the pious man, ought to respect and to cherish them. A volume could not trace all their connections with private and public felicity. Let it simply be asked, Where is the security for property, for reputation, for life, if the sense of religious obligation desert the oaths which are the instruments of investigation in courts of justice? And let us with caution indulge the supposition that morality can be maintained without religion. Whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined education on minds of peculiar structure, reason and experience both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle.

It is substantially true that virtue or morality is a necessary spring of popular government. The rule indeed extends with more or less force to every species of free government. Who that is a sincere friend to it can look with indifference upon attempts to shake the foundation of the fabric? Promote, then, as an object of primary importance, institutions 'for the general diffusion of knowledge. In proportion as the structure of a government gives force to public opinion, it is essential that public opinion should be enlightened.

As a very important source of strength and security, cherish public credit. One method of preserving it is to use it as sparingly as possible, avoiding occasions of expense by cultivating peace, but remembering also that timely disbursements to prepare for danger frequently prevent much greater disbursements to repel it; avoiding likewise the accumulation of debt, not only by shunning occasions of expense, but by vigorous exertions in time of peace to discharge the debts which unavoidable wars have occasioned, not ungenerously throwing upon posterity the burthen which we ourselves ought to bear. The execution of these maxims belongs to your representatives; but it is necessary that public opinion should cooperate. To facilitate to them the performance of their duty it is essential that you should practically bear in mind that toward the payment of debts there must be revenue; that to have revenue there must be taxes; that no taxes can be devised which are not more or less inconvenient and unpleasant; that thee intrinsic embarrassment inseparable from the selection of the proper objects (which is always a choice of difficulties), ought to be a decisive motive for a candid construction of the conduct of the Government in making it, and for a spirit of acquiescence in the measures for obtaining revenue which the public exigencies may at any time dictate.

Observe good faith and justice toward all nations. Cultivate peace and harmony with all. Religion and morality enjoin this conduct. And can it be that good policy does not equally enjoin it? It will be worthy of a free, enlightened, and at no distant period a great nation to give to mankind the magnanimous and too novel example of a people always guided by an exalted justice and benevolence. Who can doubt that in the course of time and things the fruits of such a plan would richly repay any temporary advantages which might be lost by a steady adherence to it? Can it be that Providence has not connected the permanent felicity of a nation with its virtue? The experiment, at least, is recommended by every sentiment which ennobles human nature. Alas! is it rendered impossible by its vices?

In the execution of such a plan nothing is more essential than that permanent, inveterate antipathies against particular nations and passionate attachments for others should be excluded, and that in place of them just and amicable feelings toward all should be cultivated. The nation which indulges toward another an habitual hatred or an habitual fondness is in some degree a slave. It is a slave to its animosity or to its affection, either of which is sufficient to lead it astray from its duty and its interest. Antipathy in one nation against another disposes each more readily to offer insult and injury, to lay hold of slight causes of umbrage, and to be haughty and intractable when accidental or trifling occasions of dispute occur.

Hence frequent collisions, obstinate, envenomed, and bloody contests. The nation prompted by ill will and resentment sometimes impels to war the government contrary to the best calculations of policy. The government sometimes participates in the national propensity, and adopts through passion what reason would reject. At other times it makes the animosity of the nation subservient to projects of hostility, instigated by pride, ambition, and other sinister and pernicious motives. The peace often, sometimes perhaps the liberty, of nations has been the victim.

So, likewise, a passionate attachment of one nation for another produces a variety of evils. Sympathy for the favorite nation, facilitating the illusion of an imaginary common interest in cases where no real common interest exists, and infusing into one the enmities of the other, betrays the former into a participation in the quarrels and wars of the latter without adequate inducement or justification. It leads also to concessions to the favorite nation of privileges denied to others, which is apt doubly to injure the nation making the concessions by unnecessarily parting with what ought to have been retained, and by exciting jealousy, ill will, and a disposition to retaliate in the parties from whom equal privileges are withheld; and it gives to ambitions, corrupted, or deluded citizens (who devote themselves to the favorite nation) facility to betray or sacrifice the interests of their own country without odium, sometimes even with popularity, gilding with the appearances of a virtuous sense of obligation, a commendable deference for public opinion, or a laudable zeal for public good the base or foolish compliances of ambition, corruption, or infatuation.

As avenues to foreign influence in innumerable ways, such attachments are particularly alarming to the truly enlightened and independent patriot. How many opportunities do they afford to tamper with domestic factions, to practice the arts of seduction, to mislead public opinion, to influence or awe the public councils! Such an attachment of a small or weak toward a great and powerful nation dooms the former to be the satellite of the latter. Against the insidious wiles of foreign influence ( I conjure you to believe me, fellow-citizens) the jealousy of a free people ought to be constantly awake, since history and experience prove that foreign influence is one of the most baneful foes of republican government. But that jealousy, to be useful, must be impartial, else it becomes the instrument of the very influence to be avoided, instead of a defense against it. Excessive partiality for one foreign nation and excessive dislike of another cause those whom they actuate to see danger only on one side, and serve to veil and even second the arts of influence on the other. Real patriots who may resist the intrigues of the favorite are liable to become suspected and odious, while its tools and dupes usurp the applause and confidence of the people to surrender their interests.

The great rule of conduct for us in regard to foreign nations is, in extending our commercial relations to have with them as little political connection as possible. So far as we have already formed engagements let them be fulfilled with perfect good faith. Here let us stop.

Europe has a set of primary interests which to us have none or a very remote relation. Hence she must be engaged in frequent controversies, the causes of which are essentially foreign to our concerns. Hence, therefore, it must be unwise in us to implicate ourselves by artificial ties in the ordinary vicissitudes of her politics or the ordinary combinations and collisions of her friendships or enmities.

Our detached and distant situation invites and enables us to pursue a different course. If we remain one people, under an efficient government, the period is not far off when we may defy material injury from external annoyance; when we may take such an attitude as will cause the neutrality we may at any time resolve upon to be scrupulously respected; when belligerent nations, under the impossibility of making acquisitions upon us, will not lightly hazard the giving us provocation; when we may choose peace or war, as our interest, guided by justice, shall counsel.

Why forego the advantages of so peculiar a situation? Why quit our own to stand upon foreign ground? Why, by interweaving our destiny with that of any part of Europe, entangle our peace and prosperity in the toils of European ambition, rivalship, interest, humor, or caprice?

It is our true policy to steer clear of permanent alliances with any portion of the foreign world, so far, I mean, as we are now at liberty to do it; for let me not be understood as capable of patronizing infidelity to existing engagements. I hold the maxim no less applicable to public than to private affairs that honesty is always. the best policy. I repeat, therefore, let those engagements be unwise to extend them.

Taking care always to keep ourselves by suitable establishments on a respectable defensive posture, we may safely trust to temporary alliances for extraordinary emergencies.

Harmony, liberal intercourse with all nations are recommended by policy, humanity, and interest. But even our commercial policy should hold an equal and impartial hand, neither seeking nor granting exclusive favors or preferences; consulting the natural course of things; diffusing and diversifying by gentle means the streams of commerce, but forcing nothing; establishing with powers so disposed, in order to give trade a stable course, to define the rights of our merchants, and to enable the Government to support them, conventional rules of intercourse, the best that present circumstances and mutual opinion will permit, but temporary and liable to be from time to time abandoned or varied as experience and circumstances shall dictate; constantly keeping in view that it is folly in one nation to look for disinterested favors from another; that it must pay with a portion of its independence for whatever it may accept under that character; that by such acceptance it may place itself in the condition of having given equivalents for nominal favors, and yet of being reproached with ingratitude for not giving more. There can be no greater error than to expect or calculate upon real favors from nation to nation. It is an illusion which experience must cure, which a just pride ought to discard.

In offering to you, my countrymen, these counsels of an old and affectionate friend I dare not hope they will make the strong and lasting impression I could wish--that they will control the usual current of the passions or prevent our nation from running the course which has hitherto marked the destiny of nations. But if I may even flatter myself that they may be productive of some partial benefit, some occasional good--that they may now and then recur to moderate the fury of party spirit, to warn against the mischiefs of foreign intrigue, to guard against the impostures of pretended patriotism-- this hope will be a full recompense for the solicitude for your welfare by which they have been dictated.

How far in the discharge of my official duties I have been guided by the principles which have been delineated the public records and other evidences of my conduct must witness to you and to the world. To myself, the assurance of my own conscience is that I have at least believed myself to be guided by them.

In relation to the still subsisting war in Europe my proclamation of the 22d of April, 1793, is the index to my plan. Sanctioned by your approving voice and by that of your representatives in both Houses of Congress, the spirit of that measure has continually governed me, uninfluenced by any attempts to deter or divert me from it.

After deliberate examination, with the aid of the best lights I could obtain, I was well satisfied that our country, under all the circumstances of the case, had a right to take, and was bound in duty and interest to take, a neutral position. Having taken it, I determined as far as should depend upon me to maintain it with moderation, perseverance, and firmness.

The considerations which respect the right to hold this conduct it is not necessary on this occasion to detail. I will only observe that, according to my understanding of the matter, that right, so far from being denied by any of the belligerent powers, has been virtually admitted by all.

The duty of holding a neutral conduct may be inferred, without anything more, from the obligation which justice and humanity impose on every nation, in cases in which it is free to act, to maintain inviolate the relations of peace and amity toward other nations.

The inducements of interest for observing that conduct will best be referred to your own reflections and experience. With me a predominant motive has been to endeavor to gain time to our country to settle and mature its yet recent institutions, and to progress without interruption to that degree of strength and consistency which is necessary to give it, humanly speaking, the command of its own fortunes.

Though in reviewing the incidents of my Administration I am unconscious of intentional error, I am nevertheless too sensible of my defects not to think it probable that I may have committed many errors. Whatever they may be, I fervently beseech the Almighty to avert or mitigate the evils to which they may tend. I shall also carry with me the hope that my country will never cease to view them with indulgence, and that, after forty-five years of my life dedicated to its service with an upright zeal, the faults of incompetent abilities will be consigned to oblivion, as myself must soon be to the mansions of rest.

Relying on its kindness in this as in other things, and actuated by that fervent love toward it which is so natural to a man who views in it the native soil of himself and his progenitors for several generations, I anticipate with pleasing expectation that retreat in which I promise myself to realize without alloy the sweet enjoyment of partaking in the midst of my fellow-citizens the benign influence of good laws under a free government--the ever-favorite object of my heart, and the happy reward, as I trust, of our mutual cares, labors, and dangers. Fellow Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives: In     recurring to the internal situation of our Country, since I had last the pleasure     to Address you, I find ample reason for a renewed expression of that gratitude     to the ruler of the Universe, which a continued series of prosperity has so     often and so justly called forth.  The Acts of the last Session, which required special arrangements, have been,   as far as circumstances would admit, carried into operation.  Measures calculated to insure a continuance of the friendship of the Indians,   and to preserve peace along the extent of our interior frontier, have been digested   and adopted. In the framing of these, care has been taken to guard on the one   hand, our advanced Settlements from the predatory incursions of those unruly   Individuals, who cannot be restrained by their Tribes; and on the other hand,   to protect the rights secured to the Indians by Treaty; to draw them nearer   to the civilized state; and inspire them with correct conceptions of the Power,   as well as justice of the Government.  The meeting of the deputies from the Creek Nation at Colerain, in the State   of Georgia, which had for a principal object the purchase of a parcel of their   land, by that State, broke up without its being accomplished; the Nation having,   previous to their departure, instructed them against making any Sale; the occasion   however has been improved, to confirm by a new Treaty with the Creeks, their   pre-existing engagements with the United States; and to obtain their consent,   to the establishment of Trading Houses and Military Posts within their boundary;   by means of which, their friendship, and the general peace, may be more effectually   secured.  The period during the late Session, at which the appropriation was passed,   for carrying into effect the Treaty of Amity, Commerce, and Navigation, between   the United States and his Britannic Majesty, necessarily procrastinated the   reception of the Posts stipulated to be delivered, beyond the date assigned   for that event. As soon however as the Governor General of Canada could be addressed   with propriety on the subject, arrangements were cordially and promptly concluded   for their evacuation; and the United States took possession of the principal   of them, comprehending Oswego, Niagara, Detroit, Michelimackina, and Fort Miami;   where, such repairs, and additions have been ordered to be made, as appeared   indispensible.  The Commissioners appointed on the part of the United States and of Great   Britain, to determine which is the river St. Croix, mentioned in the Treaty   of peace of 1783, agreed in the choice of Egbert Benson Esqr. of New York, for   the third Commissioner. The whole met at St. Andrews, in Passamaquoddy Bay,   in the beginning of October; and directed surveys to be made of the Rivers in   dispute; but deeming it impracticable to have these Surveys completed before   the next Year, they adjourned, to meet at Boston in August 1797, for the final   decision of the question.  Other Commissioners appointed on the part of the United States, agreeably   to the seventh Article of the Treaty with Great Britain, relative to captures   and condemnations of Vessels and other property, met the Commissioners of his   Britannic Majesty in London, in August last, when John Trumbull, Esqr. was chosen   by lot, for the fifth Commissioner. In October following the Board were to proceed   to business. As yet there has been no communication of Commissioners on the   part of Great Britain, to unite with those who have been appointed on the part   of the United States, for carrying into effect the sixth Article of the Treaty.  The Treaty with Spain, required, that the Commissioners for running the boundary   line between the territory of the United States, and his Catholic Majesty's   Provinces of East and West Florida, should meet at the Natchez, before the expiration   of six Months after the exchange of the ratifications, which was effected at   Aranjuez on the 25th. day of April; and the troops of his Catholic Majesty occupying   any Posts within the limits of the United States, were within the same period   to be withdrawn. The Commissioner of the United States therefore, commenced   his journey for the Natchez in September; and troops were ordered to occupy   the Posts from which the Spanish Garrisons should be withdrawn. Information   has been recently received, of the appointment of a Commissioner on the part   of his Catholic Majesty for running the boundary line, but none of any appointment,   for the adjustment of the claims of our Citizens, whose Vessels were captured   by the Armed Vessels of Spain.  In pursuance of the Act of Congress, passed in the last Session, for the protection   and relief of American Seamen, Agents were appointed, one to reside in Great   Britain, and the other in the West Indies. The effects of the Agency in the   West Indies, are not yet fully ascertained; but those which have been communicated   afford grounds to believe, the measure will be beneficial. The Agent destined   to reside in Great Britain, declining to accept the appointment, the business   has consequently devolved on the Minister of the United States in London; and   will command his attention, until a new Agent shall be appointed.  After many delays and disappointments, arising out of the European War, the   final arrangements for fulfilling the engagements made to the Dey and Regency   of Algiers, will, in all present appearance, be crowned with success: but under   great, tho' inevitable disadvantages, in the pecuniary transactions, occasioned   by that War; which will render a further provision necessary. The actual liberation   of all our Citizens who were prisoners in Algiers, while it gratifies every   feeling heart, is itself an earnest of a satisfactory termination of the whole   negotiation. Measures are in operation for effecting Treaties with the Regencies   of Tunis and Tripoli.  To an active external Commerce, the protection of a Naval force is indispensable.   This is manifest with regard to Wars in which a State itself is a party. But   besides this, it is in our own experience, that the most sincere Neutrality   is not a sufficient guard against the depredations of Nations at War. To secure   respect to a Neutral Flag, requires a Naval force, organized, and ready to vindicate   it, from insult or aggression. This may even prevent the necessity of going   to War, by discouraging belligerent Powers from committing such violations of   the rights of the Neutral party, as may first or last, leave no other option.   From the best information I have been able to obtain, it would seem as if our   trade to the mediterranean, without a protecting force, will always be insecure;   and our Citizens exposed to the calamities from which numbers of them have but   just been relieved.  These considerations invite the United States, to look to the means, and to   set about the gradual creation of a Navy. The increasing progress of their Navigation,   promises them, at no distant period, the requisite supply of Seamen; and their   means, in other respects, favour the undertaking. It is an encouragement, likewise,   that their particular situation, will give weight and influence to a moderate   Naval force in their hands. Will it not then be adviseable, to begin without   delay, to provide, and lay up the materials for the building and equipping of   Ships of War; and to proceed in the Work by degrees, in proportion as our resources   shall render it practicable without inconvenience; so that a future War of Europe,   may not find our Commerce in the same unprotected state, in which it was found   by the present.  Congress have repeatedly, and not without success, directed their attention   to the encouragement of Manufactures. The object is of too much consequence,   not to insure a continuance of their efforts, in every way which shall appear   eligible. As a general rule, Manufactures on public account, are inexpedient.   But where the state of things in a Country, leaves little hope that certain   branches of Manufacture will, for a great length of time obtain; when these   are of a nature essential to the furnishing and equipping of the public force   in time of War, are not establishments for procuring them on public account,   to the extent of the ordinary demand for the public service, recommended by   strong considerations of National policy, as an exception to the general rule?   Ought our Country to remain in such cases, dependant on foreign supply, precarious,   because liable to be interrupted? If the necessary Articles should, in this   mode cost more in time of peace, will not the security and independence thence   arising, form an ample compensation? Establishments of this sort, commensurate   only with the calls of the public service in time of peace, will, in time of   War, easily be extended in proportion to the exigencies of the Government; and   may even perhaps be made to yield a surplus for the supply of our Citizens at   large; so as to mitigate the privations from the interruption of their trade.   If adopted, the plan ought to exclude all those branches which are already,   or likely soon to be, established in the Country; in order that there may be   no danger of interference with pursuits of individual industry.  It will not be doubted, that with reference either to individual, or National   Welfare, Agriculture is of primary importance. In proportion as Nations advance   in population, and other circumstances of maturity, this truth becomes more   apparent; and renders the cultivation of the Soil more and more, an object of   public patronage. Institutions for promoting it, grow up, supported by the public   purse: and to what object can it be dedicated with greater propriety? Among   the means which have been employed to this end, none have been attended with   greater success than the establishment of Boards, composed of proper characters,   charged with collecting and diffusing information, and enabled by premiums,   and small pecuniary aids, to encourage and assist a spirit of discovery and   improvement. This species of establishment contributes doubly to the increase   of improvement; by stimulating to enterprise and experiment, and by drawing   to a common centre, the results everywhere of individual skill and observation;   and spreading them thence over the whole Nation. Experience accordingly has   shewn, that they are very cheap Instruments, of immense National benefits.  I have heretofore proposed to the consideration of Congress, the expediency   of establishing a National University; and also a Military Academy. The desirableness   of both these Institutions, has so constantly increased with every new view   I have taken of the subject, that I cannot omit the opportunity of once for   all, recalling your attention to them.  The Assembly to which I address myself, is too enlightened not to be fully   sensible how much a flourishing state of the Arts and Sciences, contributes   to National prosperity and reputation. True it is, that our Country, much to   its honor, contains many Seminaries of learning highly respectable and useful;   but the funds upon which they rest, are too narrow, to command the ablest Professors,   in the different departments of liberal knowledge, for the Institution contemplated,   though they would be excellent auxiliaries.  Amongst the motives to such an Institution, the assimilation of the principles,   opinions and manners of our Country men, but the common education of a portion   of our Youth from every quarter, well deserves attention. The more homogeneous   our Citizens can be made in these particulars, the greater will be our prospect   of permanent Union; and a primary object of such a National Institution should   be, the education of our Youth in the science of Government . In a Republic,   what species of knowledge can be equally important? and what duty, more pressing   on its Legislature, than to patronize a plan for communicating it to those,   who are to be the future guardians of the liberties of the Country?  The Institution of a Military Academy, is also recommended by cogent reasons.   However pacific the general policy of a Nation may be, it ought never to be   without an adequate stock of Military knowledge for emergencies. The first would   impair the energy of its character, and both would hazard its safety, or expose   it to greater evils when War could not be avoided. Besides that War, might often,   not depend upon its own choice. In proportion, as the observance of pacific   maxims, might exempt a Nation from the necessity of practising the rules of   the Military Art, ought to be its care in preserving, and transmitting by proper   establishments, the knowledge of that Art. Whatever argument may be drawn from   particular examples, superficially viewed, a thorough examination of the subject   will evince, that the Art of War, is at once comprehensive and complicated;   that it demands much previous study; and that the possession of it, in its most   improved and perfect state, is always of great moment to the security of a Nation.   This, therefore, ought to be a serious care of every Government: and for this   purpose, an Academy, where a regular course of Instruction is given, is an obvious   expedient, which different Nations have successfully employed.  The compensations to the Officers of the United States, in various instances,   and in none more than in respect to the most important stations, appear to call   for Legislative revision. The consequences of a defective provision, are of   serious import to the Government. If private wealth, is to supply the defect   of public retribution, it will greatly contract the sphere within which, the   selection of Characters for Office, is to be made, and will proportionally diminish   the probability of a choice of Men, able, as well as upright: Besides that it   would be repugnant to the vital principles of our Government, virtually to exclude   from public trusts, talents and virtue, unless accompanied by wealth.  While in our external relations, some serious inconveniences and embarrassments   have been overcome, and others lessened, it is with much pain and deep regret   I mention, that circumstances of a very unwelcome nature, have lately occurred.   Our trade has suffered, and is suffering, extensive injuries in the West Indies,   from the Cruisers, and Agents of the French Republic; and communications have   been received from its Minister here, which indicate the danger of a further   disturbance of our Commerce, by its authority; and which are, in other respects,   far from agreeable.  It has been my constant, sincere, and earnest wish, in conformity with that   of our Nation, to maintain cordial harmony, and a perfectly friendly understanding   with that Republic. This wish remains unabated; and I shall persevere in the   endeavour to fulfil it, to the utmost extent of what shall be consistent with   a just, and indispensable regard to the rights and honour of our Country; nor   will I easily cease to cherish the expectation, that a spirit of justice, candour   and friendship, on the part of the Republic, will eventually ensure success.  In pursuing this course however, I cannot forget what is due to the character   of our Government and Nation; or to a full and entire confidence in the good   sense, patriotism, selfrespect, and fortitude of my Countrymen.  I reserve for a special Message a more particular communication on this interesting   subject.  Gentlemen of the House of Representatives: I have directed an estimate of   the Appropriations, necessary for the service of the ensuing year, to be submitted   from the proper Department; with a view of the public receipts and expenditures,   to the latest period to which an account can be prepared.  It is with satisfaction I am able to inform you, that the Revenues of the   United States continue in a state of progressive improvement.  A reinforcement of the existing provisions for discharging our public Debt,   was mentioned in my Address at the opening of the last Session. Some preliminary   steps were taken towards it, the maturing of which will, no doubt, engage your   zealous attention during the present. I will only add, that it will afford me,   heart felt satisfaction, to concur in such further measures, as will ascertain   to our Country the prospect of a speedy extinguishment of the Debt. Posterity   may have cause to regret, if, from any motive, intervals of tranquillity are   left unimproved for accelerating this valuable end.  Gentlemen of the Senate, and of the House of Representatives: My solicitude   to see the Militia of the United States placed on an efficient establishment,   has been so often, and so ardently expressed, that I shall but barely recall   the subject to your view on the present occasion; at the same time that I shall   submit to your enquiry, whether our Harbours are yet sufficiently secured.  The situation in which I now stand, for the last time, in the midst of the   Representatives of the People of the United States, naturally recalls the period   when the Administration of the present form of Government commenced; and I cannot   omit the occasion, to congratulate you and my Country, on the success of the   experiment; nor to repeat my fervent supplications to the Supreme Ruler of the   Universe, and Sovereign Arbiter of Nations, that his Providential care may still   be extended to the United States; that the virtue and happiness of the People,   may be preserved; and that the Government, which they have instituted, for the   protection of their liberties, maybe perpetual. Whereas combinations to defeat the execution of the laws laying duties upon spirits distilled within the United States and upon stills have from the time of the commencement of those laws existed in some of the western parts of Pennsylvania; andWhereas the said combinations, proceeding in a manner subversive equally of the just authority of government and of the rights of individuals, have hitherto effected their dangerous and criminal purpose by the influence of certain irregular meetings whose proceedings have tended to encourage and uphold the spirit of opposition by misrepresentations of the laws calculated to render them odious; by endeavors to deter those who might be so disposed from accepting offices under them through fear of public resentment and of injury to person and property, and to compel those who had accepted such offices by actual violence to surrender or forbear the execution of them; by circulating vindictive menaces against all those who should otherwise, directly or indirectly, aid in the execution of the said laws, or who, yielding to the dictates of conscience and to a sense of obligation, should themselves comply therewith; by actually injuring and destroying the property of persons who were understood to have so complied; by inflicting cruel and humiliating punishments upon private citizens for no other cause than that of appearing to be the friends of the laws; by intercepting the public officers on the highways, abusing, assaulting, and otherwise ill treating them; by going to their houses in the night, gaining admittance by force, taking away their papers, and committing other outrages, employing for these unwarrantable purposes the agency of armed banditti disguised in such manner as for the most part to escape discovery; andWhereas the endeavors of the Legislature to obviate objections to the said laws by lowering the duties and by other alterations conducive to the convenience of those whom they immediately affect (though they have given satisfaction in other quarters), and the endeavors of the executive officers to conciliate a compliance with the laws by explanations, by forbearance, and even by particular accommodations rounded on the suggestion of local considerations, have been disappointed of their effect by the machinations of persons whose industry to excite resistance has increased with every appearance of a disposition among the people to relax in their opposition and to acquiesce in the laws, insomuch that many persons in the said western parts of Pennsylvania have at length been hardy enough to perpetrate acts which I am advised amount to treason, being overt acts of levying war against the United States, the said persons having on the 16th and 17th July last past proceeded in arms (on the second day amounting to several hundreds) to the house of John Neville, inspector of the revenue for the fourth survey of the district of Pennsylvania; having repeatedly attacked the said house with the persons therein, wounding some of them; having seized David Lenox, marshal of the district of Pennsylvania, who previous thereto had been fired upon while in the execution of his duty by a party of armed men, detaining him for some time prisoner, till for the preservation of his life and the obtaining of his liberty he found it necessary to enter into stipulations to forbear the execution of certain official duties touching processes issuing out of a court of the United States; and having finally obliged the said inspector of the said revenue and the said marshal from considerations of personal safety to fly from that part of the country, in order, by a circuitous route, to proceed to the seat of Government, avowing as the motives of these outrageous proceedings an intention to prevent by force of arms the execution of the said laws, to oblige the said inspector of the revenue to renounce his said office, to withstand by open violence the lawful authority of the Government of the United States, and to compel thereby an alteration in the measures of the Legislature and a repeal of the laws aforesaid; andWhereas by a law of the United States entitled "An act to provide calling forth the militia to execute the laws of the Union, suppress insurrections, and repel invasions," it is enacted "that whenever the laws of the United States shall be opposed or the execution thereof obstructed in any State by combinations too powerful to be suppressed by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings or by the powers vested in the marshals by that act, the same being notified by an associate justice or the district judge, it shall be lawful for the President of the United States to call forth the militia of such State to suppress such combinations and to cause the laws to be duly executed. And if the militia of a State where such combinations may happen shall refuse or be insufficient to suppress the same, it shall be lawful for the President, if the Legislature of the United States shall not be in session, to call forth and employ such numbers of the militia of any other State or States most convenient thereto as may be necessary; and the use of the militia so to be called forth may be continued, if necessary, until the expiration of thirty days after the commencement of the ensuing session: Provided always, That whenever it may be necessary in the judgment of the President to use the military force hereby directed to be called forth, the President shall forthwith, and previous thereto, by proclamation, command such insurgents to disperse and retire peaceably to their respective abodes within a limited time ;" andWhereas James Wilson, an associate justice, on the 4th instant, by writing under his hand, did from evidence which had been laid before him notify to me that "in the counties of Washington and Allegany, in Pennsylvania, laws of the United States are opposed and the execution thereof obstructed by combinations too powerful to be suppressed by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings or by the powers vested in the marshal of that district;" andWhereas it is in my judgment necessary under the circumstances of the case to take measures for calling forth the militia in order to suppress the combinations aforesaid, and to cause the laws to be duly executed; and I have accordingly determined so to do, feeling the deepest regret for the occasion, but withal the most solemn conviction that the essential interests of the Union demand it, that the very existence of Government and the fundamental principles of social order are materially involved in the issue, and that the patriotism and firmness of all good citizens are seriously called upon, as occasions may require, to aid in the effectual suppression of so fatal a spirit:Wherefore, and in pursuance of the proviso above recited, I, George Washington, President of the United States, do hereby command all persons being insurgents as aforesaid, and all others whom it may concern, on or before the 1st day of September next to disperse and retire peaceably to their respective abodes. And I do moreover warn all persons whomsoever against aiding, abetting, or comforting the perpetrators of the aforesaid treasonable acts, and do require all officers and other citizens, according to their respective duties and the laws of the land, to exert their utmost endeavors to prevent and suppress such dangerous proceedings.In testimony whereof I have caused the seal of the United States of America to be affixed to these presents, and signed the same with my hand.Done at the city of Philadelphia, the 7th day of August, 1794, and of the Independence of the United States of America the nineteenth.GO. WASHINGTON.By the President:EDM: RANDOLPF Fellow-Citizens of the Senate, and of the House of Representatives: It is some abatement of the satisfaction, with which I meet you on the present     occasion, that in felicitating you on a continuance of the National prosperity,     generally, I am not able to add to it information that the Indian hostilities,     which have for some time past distressed our North Western frontier, have terminated.  You will, I am persuaded, learn, with no less concern than I communicate it,   that reiterated endeavors, toward effecting a pacification, have hitherto issued   only in new and outrageous proofs of persevering hostility, on the part of the   tribes with whom we are in contest. An earnest desire to procure tranquillity   to the frontier; to stop the further effusion of blood; to arrest the progress   of expense; to forward the prevalent wish of the Nation, for peace, has led,   through various channels, to strenuous efforts, to accomplish these desirable   purposes: In making which efforts, I consulted less my own anticipations of   the event, or the scruples, which some considerations were calculated to inspire,   than the wish to find the object attainable; or if not attainable, to ascertain   unequivocally that such is the case.  A detail of the measures, which have been pursued, and of their consequences,   which will be laid before you, while it will confirm to you the want of success,   thus far, will, I trust, evince that means as proper and as efficacious as could   have been devised, have been employed. The issue of some of them, indeed, is   still depending; but a favourable one, though not to be despaired of, is not   promised by anything that has yet happened.  In the course of the attempts which have been made, some valuable citizens   have fallen victims to their zeal for the public service. A sanction commonly   respected even among savages, has been found, in this instance, insufficient   to protect from Massacre the emissaries of peace. It will, I presume, be duly   considered whether the occasion does not call for an exercise of liberality   towards the families of the deceased.  It must add to your concern, to be informed, that besides the continuation   of hostile appearances among the tribes North of the Ohio, some threatening   symptoms have of late been revived among some of those south of it.  A part of the Cherokees, known by the name of Chickamagas, inhabitating five   Villages on the Tennesee River, have been long in the practice of committing   depredations on the neighbouring settlements.  It was hoped that the treaty of Holstin, made with the Cherokee nation in   July 1791, would have prevented a repetition of such depredations. But the event   has not answered this hope. The Chickamagas, aided by some Banditti of another   tribe in their vicinity, have recently perpetrated wanton and unprovoked hostilities   upon the Citizens of the United States in that quarter. The information which   has been received on this subject will be laid before you. Hitherto defensive   precautions only have been strictly enjoined and observed.  It is not understood that any breach of Treaty, or aggression whatsoever,   on the part of the United States, or their Citizens, is even alleged as a pretext   for the spirit of hostility in this quarter.  I have reason to believe that every practicable exertion has been made (pursuant   to the provision by law for that purpose) to be prepared for the alternative   of a prosecution of the war, in the event of a failure of pacific overtures.   A large proportion of the troops authorized to be raised, has been recruited,   though the number is still incomplete. And pains have been taken to discipline   and put them in condition for the particular kind of service to be performed.   A delay of operations (besides being dictated by the measures which were pursuing   towards a pacific termination of the war) has been in itself deemed preferable   to immature efforts. A statement from the proper department with regard to the   number of troops raised, and some other points which have been suggested, will   afford more precise information, as a guide to the legislative consultations;   and among other things will enable Congress to judge whether some additional   stimulus to the recruiting service may not be adviseable.  In looking forward to the future expense of the operations, which may be found   inevitable, I derive consolation from the information I receive, that the product   of the revenues for the present year, is likely to supersede the necessity of   additional burthens on the community, for the service of the ensuing year. This,   however, will be better ascertained in the course of the Session; and it is   proper to add, that the information alluded to proceeds upon the supposition   of no material extension of the spirit of hostility.  I cannot dismiss the subject of Indian affairs without again recommending   to your consideration the expediency of more adequate provision for giving energy   to the laws throughout our interior frontier, and for restraining the commission   of outrages upon the Indians; without which all pacific plans must prove nugatory.   To enable, by competent rewards, the employment of qualified and trusty persons   to reside among them, as agents, would also contribute to the preservation of   peace and good neighbourhood. If, in addition to these expedients, an eligible   plan could be devised for promoting civilization among the friendly tribes,   and for carrying on trade with them, upon a scale equal to their wants, and   under regulations calculated to protect them from imposition and extortion,   its influence in cementing their interests with our's could not but be considerable.  The prosperous state of our Revenue has been intimated. This would be still   more the case, were it not for the impediments, which in some places continue   to embarrass the collection of the duties on spirits distilled within the United   States. These impediments have lessened, and are lessening in local extent,   and as applied to the community at large, the contentment with the law appears   to be progressive.  But symptoms of increased opposition having lately manifested themselves in   certain quarters, I judged a special interposition on my part, proper and adviseable;   and under this impression, have issued a proclamation, warning against all unlawful   combinations and proceedings, having for their object or tending to obstruct   the operation of the law in question, and announcing that all lawful ways and   means would be strictly put in execution for bringing to justice the infractors   thereof, and securing obedience thereto.  Measures have also been taken for the prosecution of offenders: and Congress   may be assured, that nothing within Constitutional and legal limits, which may   depend on me, shall be wanting to assert and maintain the just authority of   the laws. In fulfilling this trust, I shall count intirely upon the full cooperation   of the other departments of Government, and upon the zealous support of all   good Citizens.  I cannot forbear to bring again into the view of the Legislature the subject   of a revision of the Judiciary System. A representation from the Judges of the   Supreme Court, which will be laid before you, points out some of the inconveniences   that are experienced. In the course of the execution of the laws, considerations   arise out of the structure of that System, which, in some cases, tend to relax   their efficacy. As connected with this subject, provisions to facilitate the   taking of bail upon processes out of the Courts of the United States, and supplementary   definition of Offences against the Constitution and laws of the Union, and of   the punishment for such Offences, will, it is presumed, be found worthy of particular   attention.  Observations on the value of peace with other Nations are unnecessary. It   would be wise, however, by timely provisions, to guard against those acts of   our own Citizens, which might tend to disturb it, and to put ourselves in a   condition to give that satisfaction to foreign Nations which we may sometimes   have occasion to require from them. I particularly recommend to your consideration   the means of preventing those aggressions by our Citizens on the territory of   other nations, and other infractions of the law of Nations, which, furnishing   just subject of complaint, might endanger our peace with them. And in general,   the maintenance of a friendly intercourse with foreign powers will be presented   to your attention by the expiration of the law for that purpose, which takes   place if not renewed, at the close of the present session.  In execution of the Authority given by the legislature, measures have been   taken for engaging some artists from abroad to aid in the establishment of our   mint; others have been employed at home. Provision has been made for the requisite   buildings, and these are now putting into proper condition for the purposes   of the establishment. There has also been a small beginning in the coinage of   half-dismes; the want of small coins in circulation calling the first attention   to them.  The regulation of foreign Coins in correspondency with the principles of our   national coinage, as being essential to their due operation, and to order in   our money concerns, will, I doubt not, be resumed and completed.  It is represented that some provisions in the law, which establishes the Post-Office,   operate, in experiment, against the transmission of newspapers to distant parts   of the Country. Should this, upon due inquiry, be found to be the case, a full   conviction of the importance of facilitating the circulation of political intelligence   and information, will, I doubt not, lead to the application of a remedy. 15 [Note:On December 31 Lear wrote to the Postmaster General: "In reply to   your letter of this date requesting me to inform you of the facts or representations   communicated to the President relative to newspapers, which led him to notice   them in his Speech at the opening of the present session of Congress; I have   the honor to inform you that it was represented to the President in such a way   as to place the fact beyond a doubt in his mind, that in consequence of the   rate of postage imposed on the transmission of Newspapers by the Post-office   Law, many persons in Virginia who had heretofore taken Newspapers from this   City, had declined receiving them any longer; and that many others declared   that they only continued to take them under a full persuasion that the rate   of postage would be reduced during the present Session of Congress, and that   if such reduction should not take place, they would desire the printers to stop   their papers.  "In addition to these strong marks of disapprobation of the rate of postage   on newspapers given by individuals, he was informed that the public mind, so   far as it had been expressed in that quarter on the subject, appeared very anxious   that an alteration should take place in that part of the post office Law which   relates to the transmission of Newspapers."  This letter is entered in the "Letter Book" in the Washington Papers   . ] The adoption of a Constitution for the State of Kentucky has been notified   to me. The Legislature will share with me in the satisfaction which arises from   an event interesting to the happiness of the part of the Nation to which it   relates, and conducive to the general Order.  It is proper likewise to inform you, that since my last communication on the   subject, and in further execution of the Acts severally making provision for   the public debt, and for the reduction thereof, three new loans have been effected,   each for three millions of Florins. One at Antwerp, at the annual interest of   four and one half per Cent, with an Allowance of four per Cent in lieu of all   charges; and the other two at Amsterdam, at the annual interest of four per   Cent, with an allowance of five and one half per Cent in one case, and of five   per Cent in the other in lieu of all charges. The rates of these loans, and   the circumstances under which they have been made, are confirmations of the   high state of our Credit abroad.  Among the objects to which these funds have been directed to be applied, the   payment of the debts due to certain foreign Officers, according to the provision   made during the last Session, has been embraced.  Gentlemen of the House of Representatives: I entertain a strong hope that   the state of the national finances is now sufficiently matured to enable you   to enter upon a Systematic and effectual arrangement for the regular redemption   and discharge of the public debt, according to the right which has been reserved   served to the Government. No measure can be more desireable, whether viewed   with an eye to its intrinsic importance, or to the general sentiment and wish   of the Nation.  Provision is likewise requisite for the reimbursement of the loan which has   been made for the Bank of the United States, pursuant to the eleventh section   of the Act by which it is incorporated. In fulfilling the public stipulations   in this particular, it is expected a valuable saving will be made.  Appropriations for the current service of the ensuing year, and for such extraordinaries   as may require provision, will demand, and, I doubt not, will engage your early   attention.  Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives: I content myself   with recalling your attention, generally, to such objects, not particularized   in my present, as have been suggested in my former communications to you.  Various temporary laws will expire during the present Session. Among these,   that which regulates trade and intercourse with the Indian Tribes, will merit   particular notice.  The results of your common deliberations, hitherto, will, I trust, be productive   of solid and durable advantages to our Constituents; such as, by conciliating   more and more their ultimate suffrage, will tend to strengthen and confirm their   attachment to that constitution of Government, upon which, under Divine Providence,   materially depend their Union, their safety and their happiness.  Still further to promote and secure these inestimable ends, there is nothing   which can have a more powerful tendency, than the careful cultivation of harmony,   combined with a due regard to stability, in the public Councils. I trust I do not deceive myself when I indulge the persuasion that I have never met you at any period when more than at the present the situation of our public affairs has afforded just cause for mutual congratulation, and for inviting you to join with me in profound gratitude to the Author of all Good for the numerous and extraordinary blessings we enjoy.
The termination of the long, expensive, and distressing war in which we have been engaged with certain Indians northwest of the Ohio is placed in the option of the United States by a treaty which the commander of our army has concluded provisionally with the hostile tribes in that region.
In the adjustment of the terms the satisfaction of the Indians was deemed worthy no less of the policy than of the liberality of the United States as the necessary basis of durable tranquillity. the object, it is believed, has been fully attained. The articles agreed upon will immediately be laid before the Senate for their consideration.
The Creek and Cherokee Indians, who alone of the Southern tribes had annoyed our frontiers, have lately confirmed their preexisting treaties with us, and were giving evidence of a sincere disposition to carry them into effect by the surrender of the prisoners and property they had taken. But we have to lament that the fair prospect in this quarter has been once more clouded by wanton murders, which some citizens of Georgia are represented to have recently perpetrated on hunting parties of the Creeks, which have again subjected that frontier to disquietude and danger, which will be productive of further expense, and may occasion more effusion of blood. Measures are pursuing to prevent or mitigate the usual consequences of such outrages, and with the hope of their succeeding at least to avert general hostility.
A letter from the Emperor of Morocco announces to me his recognition of our treaty made with his father, the late Emperor, and consequently the continuance of peace with that power. With peculiar satisfaction I add that information has been received from an agent deputed on our part to Algiers importing that the terms of the treaty with the Day and Regency of that country had been adjusted in such a manner as to authorize the expectation of a speedy peace and the resolution of our unfortunate fellow citizens from a grievous captivity.
The latest advices from our envoy at the Court of Madrid give, moreover, the pleasing information that he had assurances of a speedy and satisfactory conclusion of his negotiation. While the event depending upon unadjusted particulars can not be regarded as ascertained, it is agreeable to cherish the expectation of an issue which, securing amicably very essential interests of the United States, will at the same time lay the foundation of lasting harmony with a power whose friendship we have uniformly and sincerely desired to cultivate.
Though not before officially disclosed to the House of Representatives, you, gentlemen, are all apprised that a treaty of amity, commerce, and navigation has been negotiated with Great Britain, and that the Senate have advised and consented to its ratification upon a condition which excepts part of one article. Agreeably thereto, and to the best judgment I was able to form of the public interest after full and mature deliberation, I have added my sanction. The result on the part of His Britannic Majesty is unknown. When received, the subject will without delay be placed before Congress.
This interesting summary of our affairs with regard to the foreign powers between whom and the United States controversies have subsisted, and with regard also to those of our Indian neighbors with whom we have been in a state of enmity or misunderstanding, opens a wide field for consoling and gratifying reflections. If by prudence and moderation on every side the extinguishment of all the causes of external discord which have heretofore menaced our tranquillity, on terms compatible with our national rights and honor, shall be the happy result, how firm and how precious a foundation will have been laid for accelerating, maturing, and establishing the prosperity of our country.
Contemplating the internal situation as well as the external relations of the United States, we discover equal cause for contentment and satisfaction. While many of the nations of Europe, with their American dependencies, have been involved in a contest unusually bloody, exhausting, and calamitous, in which the evils of foreign war have been aggravated by domestic convulsion and insurrection; in which many of the arts most useful to society have been exposed to discouragement and decay; in which scarcity of subsistence has imbittered other sufferings; while even the anticipations of a return of the blessings of peace and repose are alloyed by the sense of heavy and accumulating burthens, which press upon all the departments of industry and threaten to clog the future springs of government, our favored country, happy in a striking contrast, has enjoyed tranquillity—a tranquillity the more satisfactory because maintained at the expense of no duty. Faithful to ourselves, we have violated no obligation to others.
Our agriculture, commerce, and manufactures prosper beyond former example, the molestations of our trade (to prevent a continuance of which, however, very pointed remonstrances have been made) being overbalanced by the aggregate benefits which it derives from a neutral position. Our population advances with a celerity which, exceeding the most sanguine calculations, proportionally augments our strength and resources, and guarantees our future security.
Every part of the Union displays indications of rapid and various improvement; and with burthens so light as scarcely to be perceived, with resources fully adequate to our present exigencies, with governments founded on the genuine principles of rational liberty, and with mild and wholesome laws, is it too much to say that our country exhibits a spectacle of national happiness never surpassed, if ever before equaled?
Placed in a situation every way so auspicious, motives of commanding force impel us, with sincere acknowledgment to Heaven and pure love to our country, to unite our efforts to preserve, prolong, and improve our immense advantages. To cooperate with you in this desirable work is a fervent and favorite wish of my heart.
It is a valuable ingredient in the general estimate of our welfare that the part of our country which was lately the scene of disorder and insurrection now enjoys the blessings of quiet and order. The misled have abandoned their errors, and pay the respect to our Constitution and laws which is due from good citizens to the public authorities of the society. These circumstances have induced me to pardon generally the offenders here referred to, and to extend forgiveness to those who had been adjudged to capital punishment. For though I shall always think it a sacred duty to exercise with firmness and energy the constitutional powers with which I am vested, yet it appears to me no less consistent with the public good than it is with my personal feelings to mingle in the operations of Government every degree of moderation and tenderness which the national justice, dignity, and safety may permit.
Gentlemen: Among the objects which will claim your attention in the course of the session, a review of our military establishment is not the least important. It is called for by the events which have changed, and may be expected still further to change, the relative situation of our frontiers. In this review you will doubtless allow due weight to the considerations that the questions between us and certain foreign powers are not yet finally adjusted, that the war in Europe is not yet terminated, and that our Western posts, when recovered, will demand provision for garrisoning and securing them. A statement of our present military force will be laid before you by the Department of War.
With the review of our Army establishment is naturally connected that of the militia. It will merit inquiry what imperfections in the existing plan further experience may have unfolded. The subject is of so much moment in my estimation as to excite a constant solicitude that the consideration of it may be renewed until the greatest attainable perfection shall be accomplished. Time is wearing away some advantages for forwarding the object, while none better deserves the persevering attention of the public councils.
While we indulge the satisfaction which the actual condition of our Western borders so well authorizes, it is necessary that we should not lose sight of an important truth which continually receives new confirmations, namely, that the provisions heretofore made with a view to the protection of the Indians from the violences of the lawless part of our frontier inhabitants are insufficient. It is demonstrated that these violences can now be perpetrated with impunity, and it can need no argument to prove that unless the murdering of Indians can be restrained by bringing the murderers to condign punishment, all the exertions of the Government to prevent destructive retaliations by the Indians will prove fruitless and all our present agreeable prospects illusory. The frequent destruction of innocent women and children, who are chiefly the victims of retaliation, must continue to shock humanity, and an enormous expense to drain the Treasury of the Union.
To enforce upon the Indians the observance of justice it is indispensable that there shall be competent means of rendering justice to them. If these means can be devised by the wisdom of Congress, and especially if there can be added an adequate provision for supplying the necessities of the Indians on reasonable terms (a measure the mention of which I the more readily repeat, as in all the conferences with them they urge it with solicitude), I should not hesitate to entertain a strong hope of rendering our tranquillity permanent. I add with pleasure that the probability even of their civilization is not diminished by the experiments which have been thus far made under the auspices of Government. The accomplishment of this work, if practicable, will reflect undecaying luster on our national character and administer the most grateful consolations that virtuous minds can know.
Gentlemen of the House of Representatives:
The state of our revenue, with the sums which have been borrowed and reimbursed pursuant to different acts of Congress, will be submitted from the proper Department, together with an estimate of the appropriations necessary to be made for the service of the ensuing year.
Whether measures may not be advisable to reinforce the provision of the redemption of the public debt will naturally engage your examination. Congress have demonstrated their sense to be, and it were superfluous to repeat mine, that whatsoever will tend to accelerate the honorable extinction of our public debt accords as much with the true interest of our country as with the general sense of our constituents.
Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives:
The statements which will be laid before you relative to the Mint will shew the situation of that institution and the necessity of some further legislative provisions for carrying the business of it more completely into effect, and for checking abuses which appear to be arising in particular quarters.
The progress in providing materials for the frigates and in building them, the state of the fortifications of our harbors, the measures which have been pursued for obtaining proper sites for arsenals and for replenishing our magazines with military stores, and the steps which have been taken toward the execution of the law for opening a trade with the Indians will likewise be presented for the information of Congress.
Temperate discussion of the important subjects which may arise in the course of the session and mutual forbearance where there is a difference of opinion are too obvious and necessary for the peace, happiness, and welfare of our country to need any recommendation of mine.Beloved Cherokees,

Many years have passed since the White people first came to America. In that long space of time many good men have considered how the condition of the Indian natives of the country might be improved; and many attempts have been made to effect it. But, as we see at this day, all these attempts have been nearly fruitless. I also have thought much on this subject, and anxiously wished that the various Indian tribes, as well as their neighbours, the White people, might enjoy in abundance all the good things which make life comfortable and happy. I have considered how this could be done; and have discovered but one path that could lead them to that desirable situation. In this path I wish all the Indian nations to walk. From the information received concerning you, my beloved Cherokees, I am inclined to hope that you are prepared to take this path and disposed to pursue it. It may seem a little difficult to enter; but if you make the attempt, you will find every obstacle easy to be removed. Mr. Dinsmoor, my beloved agent to your nation, being here, I send you this talk by him. He will have it interpreted to you, and particularly explain my meaning.

Beloved Cherokees,

You now find that the game with which your woods once abounded, are growing scarce; and you know when you cannot meet a deer or other game to kill, that you must remain hungry; you know also when you can get no skins by hunting, that the traders will give you neither powder nor cloathing; and you know that without other implements for tilling the ground than the hoe, you will continue to raise only scanty crops of corn. Hence you are sometimes exposed to suffer much from hunger and cold; and as the game are lessening in numbers more and more, these sufferings will increase. And how are you to provide against them? Listen to my words and you will know.

My beloved Cherokees,

Some among you already experience the advantage of keeping cattle and hogs: let all keep them and increase their numbers, and you will ever have a plenty
of meet. To these add sheep, and they will give you cloathing as well as food. Your lands are good and of great extent. By proper management you can raise live stock not only for your own wants, but to sell to the White people. By using the plow you can vastly increase your crops of corn. You can also grow wheat, (which makes the best bread) as well as other useful grain. To these you will easily add flax and cotton, which you may dispose of to the White people, or have it made up by your own women into cloathing for yourselves. Your wives and daughters can soon learn to spin and weave; and to make this certain, I have directed Mr. Dinsmoor, to procure all the necessary apparatus for spinning and weaving, and to hire a woman to teach the use of them. He will also procure some plows and other implements of husbandry, with which to begin the improved cultivation of the ground which I recommend, and employ a fit person to shew you how they are to be used. I have further directed him to procure some cattle and sheep for the most prudent and industrious men, who shall be willing to exert themselves in tilling the ground and raising those useful animals. He is often to talk with you on these subjects, and give you all necessary information to promote your success. I must therefore desire you to listen to him; and to follow his advice. I appointed him to dwell among you as the Agent of the United States, because I judged him to be a faithful man, ready to obey my instructions and to do you good.

But the cares of the United States are not confined to your single nation.
They extend to all the Indians dwelling on their borders. For which reason other agents are appointed; and for the four southern nations there will be a general or principal agent who will visit all of them, for the purpose of maintaining peace and friendship among them and with the United States; to superintend all their affairs; and to assist the particular agents with each nation in doing the business assigned them. To such general or principal agent I must desire your careful attention. He will be one of our greatly beloved men. His whole time will be employed in contriving how to do you good, and you will therefore act wisely to follow his advice. The first general or principal agent will be Colonel Benjamin Hawkins, a man already known and respected by you. I have chosen him for this office because he is esteemed for a good man; has a knowledge of Indian customs, and a particular love and friendship for all the Southern tribes.

Beloved Cherokees,

What I have recommended to you I am myself going to do. After a few moons are passed I shall leave the great town and retire to my farm. There I shall attend to the means of increasing my cattle, sheep and other useful animals; to the growing of corn, wheat, and other grain, and to the employing of women in spinning and weaving; all which I have recommended to you, that you may be as comfortable and happy as plenty of food, clothing and other good things can make you.

Beloved Cherokees,

When I have retired to my farm I shall hear of you; and it will give me great pleasure to know that you have taken my advice, and are walking in the path which I have described. But before I retire, I shall speak to my beloved man, the Secretary of War, to get prepared some medals, to be given to such Cherokees as by following my advice shall best deserve them. For this purpose Mr. Dinsmoor is from time to time to visit every town in your nation. He will give instructions to those who desire to learn what I have recommended. He will see what improvements are made; who are most industrious in raising cattle; in growing corn, wheat, cotton and flax; and in spinning and weaving; and on those who excel these rewards are to be bestowed.

Beloved Cherokees,

The advice I here give you is important as it regards your nation; but still
more important as the event of the experiment made with you may determine the
lot of many nations. If it succeeds, the beloved men of the United States will be encouraged to give the same assistance to all the Indian tribes within their boundaries. But if it should fail, they may think it vain to make any further attempts to better the condition of any Indian tribe; for the richness of the soil and mildness of the air render your country highly favorable for the practice of what I have recommended.

Beloved Cherokees,

The wise men of the United States meet together once a year, to consider what
will be for the good of all their people. The wise men of each separate state also meet together once or twice every year, to consult and do what is good for the people of their respective states. I have thought that a meeting of your wise men once or twice a year would be alike useful to you. Every town might send one or two of its wisest counsellors to talk together on the affairs of your nation, and to recommend to your people whatever they should think would be serviceable. The beloved agent of the United States would meet with them. He would give them information of those things which are found good by the white people, and which your situation will enable you to adopt. He would explain to them the laws made by the great council of the United States, for the preservation of peace; for the protection of your lands; for the security of your persons; for your improvement in the arts of living, and for promoting your general welfare. If it should be agreeable to you that your wise men should hold such meetings, you will speak your mind to my beloved man, Mr. Dinsmoor, to be communicated to the President of the United States, who will give such directions as shall be proper.

Beloved Cherokees,

That this talk may be known to all your nation, and not forgotten, I have caused it to be printed, and directed one, signed by my own hand, to be lodged in each of your towns. The Interpreters will, on proper occasions, read and interpret the same to all your people.

Beloved Cherokees,

Having been informed that some of your chiefs wished to see me in Philadelphia, I have sent them word that I would receive a few of the most esteemed. I now repeat that I shall be glad to see a small number of your wisest chiefs; but I shall not expect them 'till November. I shall take occasion to agree with them on the running of the boundary line between your lands and ours, agreeably to the treaty of Holston. I shall expect them to inform me what chiefs are to attend the running of this line, and I shall tell them whom I appoint to run it; and the time and place of beginning may then be fixed.

I now send my best wishes to the Cherokees, and pray the Great spirit to preserve them.
